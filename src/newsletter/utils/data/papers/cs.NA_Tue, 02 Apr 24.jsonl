Although a large ensemble size is required for statistical accuracy, the ensemble size is typically limited to a small number due to the computational cost of running the prediction model, which leads to a sampling error. Several methods, such as localization, exist to mitigate the sampling error, often requiring problem-dependent fine-tuning and design. This work introduces another sampling error mitigation method using a smoothness constraint in the Fourier space. In particular, this work smoothes out the spectrum of the system to increase the stability and accuracy even under a small ensemble size. The efficacy of the new idea is validated through a suite of stringent test problems, including Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky turbulence models."}

Solutions could be interpreted as expected values of functions in a random time process. As applications, we solve the fractional beam equation, fractional electric circuits with special functions as external sources, and derive dAlemberts formula for the fractional wave equation. Due to this relationship, we present two methods for simulating solutions of fractional differential equations. The two approaches use the interpretation of the Caputo derivative of a function as a Wright-type transformation of the higher derivative of the function. In the first approach, we use the Runge-Kutta method of hybrid orders 4 and 5 to solve ordinary differential equations combined with the Monte Carlo integration to conduct the Wrighttype transformation. The second method uses a feedforward neural network to simulate the fractional differential equation."}

Specifically, we define the geometric mean of two T-positive definite tensors and verify several properties that \"mean\" should satisfy including the idempotence and the commutative property, and so on. Moreover, it is shown that the geometric mean is a unique T-positive definite solution of an algebraic Riccati tensor equation and can be expressed as solutions of algebraic Riccati matrix equations. In addition, we investigate the Riemannian manifold associated with the geometric mean for T-positive definite tensors, considering it as a totally geodesic embedded submanifold of the Riemannian manifold associated with the case of matrices. It is particularly shown that the geometric mean of two T-positive definite tensors is the midpoint of a unique geodesic joining the tensors, and the manifold is a Cartan-Hadamard-Riemannian manifold."}

The purpose of this paper is the design of efficient numerical schemes to approximate the solution of initial-boundary value problems with these equations. The efficiency stems from the implicit treatment of the high-order terms in the equations. Our proposal is a second-order linearly implicit-explicit time stepping scheme applied in a method of lines approach, in which the convective terms are treated explicitly and only linear systems have to be solved. Some experiments are performed to assess the validity and efficiency of this proposal."}

Sonner", "subjects": "Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)", "abstract": "We propose and analyse numerical schemes for a system of quasilinear, degenerate evolution equations modelling biofilm growth as well as other processes such as flow through porous media and the spreading of wildfires. The first equation in the system is parabolic and exhibits degenerate and singular diffusion, while the second is either uniformly parabolic or an ordinary differential equation. First, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretisation that has the benefit of decoupling the equations. We prove the positivity, boundedness, and convergence of the time-discrete solutions to the time-continuous solution. Then, we introduce an iterative linearisation scheme to solve the resulting nonlinear time-discrete problems. Under weak assumptions on the time-step size, we prove that the scheme converges irrespective of the space discretisation and mesh. Moreover, if the problem is non-degenerate, the convergence becomes faster as the time-step size decreases. Finally, employing the finite element method for the spatial discretisation, we study the behaviour of the scheme, and compare its performance to other commonly used schemes. These tests confirm that the proposed scheme is robust and fast."}

Some of the most popular approximation methods include the Lebesgue approximation theorem, the Weierstrass approximation, and the Fourier approximation theorem.

In this report, we shall delve into Chebyshev's polynomials interpolation in detail as an alternative approach to reconstructing signals and compare the reconstruction to that of the Fourier polynomials. We will also explore the advantages and limitations of the Chebyshev polynomials and discuss in detail their mathematical formulation and equivalence to the cosine function over a given interval [a, b]."}

In this paper, we provide a new understanding of GSVD from the viewpoint of SVD, based on which we propose a new iterative method for computing nontrivial GSVD components of a large-scale matrix pair. By introducing two linear operators $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{L}$ induced by $\\{A, L\\}$ between two finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and applying the theory of singular value expansion (SVE) for linear compact operators, we show that the GSVD of $\\{A, L\\}$ is nothing but the SVEs of $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{L}$. This result characterizes completely the structure of GSVD for any matrix pair with the same number of columns. As a direct application of this result, we generalize the standard Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization (GKB) that is a basic routine for large-scale SVD computation such that the resulting generalized GKB (gGKB) process can be used to approximate nontrivial extreme GSVD components of $\\{A, L\\}$, which is named the gGKB\\_GSVD algorithm. We use the GSVD of $\\{A, L\\}$ to study several basic properties of gGKB and also provide preliminary results about convergence and accuracy of gGKB\\_GSVD for GSVD computation. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method."}

These approaches enjoy convexity and counteract the discretisation biases as well the numerical instabilities typical of their discrete counterparts. In the framework of sparse reconstruction of discrete point measures (sum of weighted Diracs), a Total Variation regularisation norm in $\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{X})$ is typically combined with an $L^2$ data term modelling additive Gaussian noise. To asses the framework of off-the-grid regularisation in the presence of signal-dependent Poisson noise, we consider in this work a variational model coupling the Total Variation regularisation with a Kullback-Leibler data term under a non-negativity constraint. Analytically, we study the optimality conditions of the composite functional and analyse its dual problem. Then, we consider an homotopy strategy to select an optimal regularisation parameter and use it within a Sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Several numerical experiments on both 1D/2D simulated and real 3D fluorescent microscopy data are reported."}

Recent work by Boull\\'e and Townsend (FoCM, 2023) presents an infinite-dimensional analog of the randomized SVD to approximate Hilbert-Schmidt operators. However, many applications involve computing low-rank approximations to symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. In this setting, it is well-established that the randomized Nystr{\\\"o}m approximation is usually preferred over the randomized SVD. This paper explores an infinite-dimensional analog of the Nystr{\\\"o}m approximation to compute low-rank approximations to non-negative self-adjoint trace-class operators. We present an analysis of the method and, along the way, improve the existing infinite-dimensional bounds for the randomized SVD. Our analysis yields bounds on the expected value and tail bounds for the Nystr{\\\"o}m approximation error in the operator, trace, and Hilbert-Schmidt norms. Numerical experiments for simple integral operators validate the proposed framework."}

This work shows that sequential-in-time training methods can be understood broadly as either optimize-then-discretize (OtD) or discretize-then-optimize (DtO) schemes, which are well known concepts in numerical analysis. The unifying perspective leads to novel stability and a posteriori error analysis results that provide insights into theoretical and numerical aspects that are inherent to either OtD or DtO schemes such as the tangent space collapse phenomenon, which is a form of over-fitting. Additionally, the unified perspective facilitates establishing connections between variants of sequential-in-time training methods, which is demonstrated by identifying natural gradient descent methods on energy functionals as OtD schemes applied to the corresponding gradient flows."}

This framework, named relaxation neural networks(RelaxNN), is a simple and scalable extension of physics-informed neural networks(PINN). It is shown later that a typical PINN framework struggles to handle shock waves that arise in hyperbolic systems' solutions. This ultimately results in the failure of optimization that is based on gradient descent in the training process. Relaxation systems provide a smooth asymptotic to the discontinuity solution, under the expectation that macroscopic problems can be solved from a microscopic perspective. Based on relaxation systems, the RelaxNN framework alleviates the conflict of losses in the training process of the PINN framework. In addition to the remarkable results demonstrated in numerical simulations, most of the acceleration techniques and improvement strategies aimed at the standard PINN framework can also be applied to the RelaxNN framework."}

Math. 149, 2021] require a parameter $C_{\\mathrm{st},1}$ that is found $\\textit{not}$ robust as the polynomial degree $p$ increases. This is related to the $H^1$ stability bound of the $L^2$ projection onto polynomials of degree at most $p$ and its growth $C_{\\rm st, 1}\\propto (p+1)^{1/2}$ as $p \\to \\infty$. A similar estimate for the Galerkin projection holds with a $p$-robust constant $C_{\\mathrm{st},2}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{st},2} \\le 2$ for right-isosceles triangles. This paper utilizes the new inequality with the constant $C_{\\mathrm{st},2}$ to design a modified hybrid high-order (HHO) eigensolver that directly computes guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds under the idealized hypothesis of exact solve of the generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem and a mild explicit condition on the maximal mesh-size in the simplicial mesh. A key advance is a $p$-robust parameter selection. The analysis of the new method with a different fine-tuned volume stabilization allows for a priori quasi-best approximation and improved $L^2$ error estimates as well as a stabilization-free reliable and efficient a posteriori error control. The associated adaptive mesh-refining algorithm performs superior in computer benchmarks with striking numerical evidence for optimal higher empirical convergence rates."}
