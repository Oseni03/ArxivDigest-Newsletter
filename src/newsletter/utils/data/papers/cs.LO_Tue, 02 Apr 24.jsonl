Choosing Prime Event Structures (PESs) as our semantic model, we present semantic counterparts for the two properties that underpin global type well-formedness, namely projectability and boundedness, in this model. As a first step towards a characterisation of the class of PESs corresponding to well-formed global types, we identify some simple structural properties satisfied by such PESs."}

In this paper, we delve into the details of this correspondence and concretely show how to construct a composite theory from a distributive law and vice versa. Using term rewriting methods, we also describe when a minimal set of equations axiomatises the composite theory."}
