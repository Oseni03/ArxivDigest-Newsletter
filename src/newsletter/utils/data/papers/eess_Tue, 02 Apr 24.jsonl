Nevertheless, it is not able to compensate for the effects produced by modeling errors or disturbances. A solution to improve the feedforward performance is the use of an adaptation law that modifies the parameters of the feedforward control. In the case where real-time feedback is not possible, a solution is a run-to-run numerical optimization method that is fed with a cost based on a measured signal. Although the effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated, its performance is hindered by slow convergence. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on Pattern Search and Adaptive Coordinate Descent methods that makes use of the sensitivity of the feedforward controller to its parameters so that the convergence speed improves significantly. Like many algorithms, this is a local strategy so the algorithm might converge to a local minimum. Therefore, we present two versions, one without a learning rate and one with it. To compare them and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, simulated results are shown on a well-known control problem in electromechanics: the soft-landing control of electromechanical switching devices."}

This work explores the use of deep learning models for intracardiac Doppler velocity estimation from a reduced number of filtered I/Q signals. We used a supervised learning approach by simulating patient-based cardiac color Doppler acquisitions and proposed data augmentation strategies to enlarge the training dataset. We implemented architectures based on convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focused on comparing the U-Net model and the recent ConvNeXt models, alongside assessing real-valued versus complex-valued representations. We found that both models outperformed the state-of-the-art autocorrelator method, effectively mitigating aliasing and noise. We did not observe significant differences between the use of real and complex data. Finally, we validated the models on in vitro and in vivo experiments. All models produced quantitatively comparable results to the baseline and were more robust to noise. ConvNeXt emerged as the sole model to achieve high-quality results on in vivo aliased samples.

The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable FDN with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent FDNs capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics, and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical filter design."}

In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Multi-modal Fusion framework (CAMF), which aims to capture both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships between fMRI and sMRI, enhancing multi-modal data representation. Specifically, our CAMF framework employs self-attention modules to identify interactions within each modality while cross-attention modules identify interactions between modalities.

This approach significantly improves classification accuracy, as demonstrated by our evaluations on two extensive multi-modal brain imaging datasets, where CAMF consistently outperforms existing methods.

The results illustrate that a simple algorithm that only seeks to satisfy unit commitment, reserve, and AC power balance constraints can obtain surprisingly high-quality solutions to this AC unit commitment problem. However, a naive strategy that prioritizes reserve feasibility leads to AC infeasibility, motivating the need to design heuristics that can effectively balance reserve and AC feasibility.

However, the high computational complexity associated with these approaches impedes their integration with other modules or deployment on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices. To address this need, we propose a novel image saliency detection method named GreenSaliency, which has a small model size, minimal carbon footprint, and low computational complexity. GreenSaliency can be a competitive alternative to the existing deep-learning-based (DL-based) image saliency detection methods with limited computation resources. GreenSaliency comprises two primary steps: 1) multi-layer hybrid feature extraction and 2) multi-path saliency prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that GreenSaliency achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art DL-based methods while possessing a considerably smaller model size and significantly reduced computational complexity."}

The simulations results reveal several conclusions: 1) errors on the down blocks of the creator have a larger impact on the quality of the generated images than those on the up blocks, while the errors on middle block have negligible effect; 2) errors on the self-attention (SA) layers have larger impact on the results than those on the cross-attention (CA) layers; 3) for CA layers, errors on deeper levels result in a larger impact; 4) errors on blocks at the first levels tend to introduce noise in the image, and those on deep layers tend to introduce large colored blocks.

We also consider diffusive PDEs with or without linear convection, for which a weighted L2 norm is a CLF whose derivative has a quadratic dependence in the control input. For each structure on the derivative of the CLF, we achieve inverse optimality with respect to a meaningful cost functional. For the case where the derivative of the CLF has a depressed cubic dependence in the control, we construct a cost functional for which the unique minimizer is the unique real root of a cubic polynomial: the Cardano-Lyapunov controller. When the derivative of the CLF is quadratic in the control, we construct a cost functional that is minimized by two distinct feedback laws, that correspond to the two distinct real roots of a quadratic equation. We show how to switch from one root to the other to reduce the control effort."}

The first type maximizes an additional fairness objective along with the main objective of curtailment minimization. The second type is formulated as a feedback controller, where fairness is accounted for by assigning different weights (as feedback) in the curtailment minimization objective for each PV plant based on previous curtailment actions. In this work, we combine these two schemes and provide extensive analyses and comparisons of these two fairness schemes.

The term \"colonic polyps\" refers to polypoid lesions that occur on the surface of the colonic mucosa within the intestinal lumen. In clinical practice, early detection of polyps is conducted through colonoscopy examinations and biomedical image processing. Therefore, the accurate polyp image segmentation is of great significance in colonoscopy examinations. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a common automatic segmentation method, but its main disadvantage is the long training time. Transformer utilizes a self-attention mechanism, which essentially assigns different importance weights to each piece of information, thus achieving high computational efficiency during segmentation. However, a potential drawback is the risk of information loss. In the study reported in this paper, based on the well-known hybridization principle, we proposed a method to combine CNN and Transformer to retain the strengths of both, and we applied this method to build a system called MugenNet for colonic polyp image segmentation. We conducted a comprehensive experiment to compare MugenNet with other CNN models on five publicly available datasets. The ablation experiment on MugentNet was conducted as well. The experimental results show that MugenNet achieves significantly higher processing speed and accuracy compared with CNN alone. The generalized implication with our work is a method to optimally combine two complimentary methods of machine learning."}

Traditionally, research in this field predominantly focused on utilizing handcrafted features or raw signals as inputs for learning algorithms. However, there is now a burgeoning interest within the community in leveraging large-scale vision foundation models (VFMs) like ResNet50, VGG19, and others. These VFMs are increasingly preferred due to their ability to capture complex features, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of stress recognition systems. However, no particular focus has been given on combining these VFMs. The combination of VFMs offers promising benefits by harnessing their collective knowledge to extract richer representations for improved stress recognition. So, to mitigate this research gap, we focus on combining different VFMs for stress recognition from ECG and propose SONIC, a novel framework that combines VFMs through their logits and training a fully connected network on the combined logits. Through extensive experimentation, SONIC showed the top performance against individual VFMs performance on the WESAD benchmark.

Due to the presence of low-quality noisy videos in such cases, AV-ASD systems without a selective listening ability are short of effectively filtering out disruptive voice components from mixed audio inputs.

A strategy, based on a hybrid machine-learning and signal-processing algorithm, is proposed in this paper to tackle this problem of site-specific impurities. In addition, a soil pixel alignment strategy is proposed here to visualize the relative purity of the target minerals. The proposed methodologies are validated via case studies for mapping of Limestone deposits in Jaffna, Ilmenite deposits in Pulmoddai and Mannar, and Montmorillonite deposits in Murunkan, Sri Lanka. The results of satellite-based spectral imaging analysis were corroborated with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Magnetic Separation (MS) analysis of soil samples collected from those sites via field surveys.

In this paper, we study DTs used as a development environment to design, deploy, and test artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that use real-time observations, e.g. radio key performance indicators, for vehicle trajectory and network optimization decisions in an autonomous vehicle networks (AVN).

With a probabilistic air-to-ground channel model, a multi-user MIMO uplink communication model with prioritized traffic, and a novel 3D mobility model for rotary-wing UAVs, the fleet-wide reward maximization problem is solved via a cross-layer optimization framework: first, K-means clustering is employed to obtain user clusters; then, equipped with a zero-forcing beam-forming design, the positions of the UAVs are optimized via two-stage grid search; next, treating these optimal positions as the graph vertices of a fully-connected mesh, the 3D UAV trajectories (i.e., graph edges) are designed via a learning based competitive swarm optimization algorithm, under an average UAV power consumption constraint, coupled with projected subgradient ascent for dual optimization; consequently, the user association/scheduling strategy is solved via a graphical branch-and-bound method on the underlying multiple traveling salesman problem. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms static UAV deployments, adaptive Voronoi decomposition techniques, and state-of-the-art iterative fleet control algorithms, with respect to user quality-of-service and per-UAV average power consumption."}

The utility company incentivizes load aggregators to adjust their pre-scheduled energy consumption and generation to match the supply. Each aggregator, which represents a group of prosumers, aims to maximize its revenue by bidding strategically in the demand response scheme. Since aggregators act in their own self-interest and their revenues and feasible bids influence one another, we model their competition as a network-constrained aggregative game. This model incorporates power flow constraints to prevent potential line congestion. Given that there are no coordinators and aggregators can only communicate with their neighbours, we introduce a fully distributed generalized Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm to determine the optimal bidding strategies for aggregators in this game. Within this algorithm, only estimates of the aggregate and certain auxiliary variables are communicated among neighbouring aggregators. We demonstrate the convergence of this algorithm by constructing an equivalent iteration using the forward-backward splitting technique."}

To mitigate the effects of selfish behavior, central planners can use dynamic payments to guide strategic multi-agent systems toward stability and socially optimal outcomes. However, the effectiveness of such interventions critically relies on accurately predicting agents' responses to incentives and dynamically adjusting payments so that the system is guided towards the desired outcomes. These challenges are further amplified in real-time applications where the dynamics are unknown and only scarce data is available. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce the SIAR-MPC method, combining the recently introduced Side Information Assisted Regression (SIAR) method for system identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC). SIAR utilizes side-information constraints inherent to game theoretic applications to model agent responses to payments from scarce data, while MPC uses this model to facilitate dynamic payment adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of SIAR-MPC in guiding the system towards socially optimal equilibria, stabilizing chaotic behaviors, and avoiding specified regions of the state space. Comparative analyses in data-scarce settings show SIAR-MPC's superior performance over pairing MPC with Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a powerful system identification method that finds models satisfying specific constraints."}

However, a vast body of existing cross-modality image translation methods relies on supervised learning. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of zero-shot learning-based image translation tasks (extreme scenarios in the target modality is unseen in the training phase). To leverage generative learning for zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation, we propose a novel unsupervised image translation method. The framework learns to translate the unseen source image to the target modality for image segmentation by leveraging the inherent statistical consistency between different modalities for diffusion guidance. Our framework captures identical cross-modality features in the statistical domain, offering diffusion guidance without relying on direct mappings between the source and target domains. This advantage allows our method to adapt to changing source domains without the need for retraining, making it highly practical when sufficient labeled source domain data is not available. The proposed framework is validated in zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation tasks through empirical comparisons with influential generative models, including adversarial-based and diffusion-based models."}

The design extends the first-order Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm that drives the system toward its peak point. This work provides perturbation matrices to estimate the second- and third-order derivatives necessary for implementation of the SONES. A set of conditions are provided for the probing frequencies that ensure accurate estimation of the derivatives. A differential Riccati filter is used to calculate the inverse of the third-order derivative. The local stability of the new algorithm is proven for general multivariable static maps using averaging analysis. The proposed algorithm ensures uniform convergence toward directional inflection point without requiring information about the curvature of the map and its gradient. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

Clark IV, Joseph M. Ernst, Robert W. McGwier", "subjects": "Signal Processing (eess.SP)", "abstract": "Cognitive Radios (CRs) build upon Software Defined Radios (SDRs) to allow for autonomous reconfiguration of communication architectures. In recent years, CRs have been identified as an enabler for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) applications in which secondary users opportunistically share licensed spectrum. A major challenge for DSA is accurately characterizing the spectral environment, which requires blind signal classification. Existing work in this area has focused on simplistic channel models; however, more challenging fading channels (e.g., frequency selective fading channels) cause existing methods to be computationally complex or insufficient. This paper develops a novel blind modulation classification algorithm, which uses a set of higher order statistics to overcome these challenges. The set of statistics forms a signature, which can either be used directly for classification or can be processed using big data analytical techniques, such as principle component analysis (PCA), to learn the environment. The algorithm is tested in simulation on both flat fading and selective fading channel models. Results of this blind classification algorithm are shown to improve upon those which use single value higher order statistical methods."}

The application of soft-landing control strategies to these devices aims at minimizing the impact velocities of their moving components to ultimately improve their lifetime and performance. In this paper, a novel approach for soft-landing trajectory planning, including probability functions, is proposed for optimal control of the actuators. The main contribution of the proposal is that it considers uncertainty in the contact position and hence the obtained trajectories are more robust against system uncertainties. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and transformed into a two-point boundary value problem for its numerical resolution. Simulated and experimental tests have been performed using a dynamic model and a commercial short-stroke solenoid valve. The results show a significant improvement in the expected velocities and accelerations at contact with respect to past solutions in which the contact position is assumed to be perfectly known."}

Therefore, the voltage oscillation phenomenon is easy to happen, threatening the safe and stable operation of the grid. Its dynamic process and evolution mechanism need to be studied urgently. This paper firstly analyzes conditions for voltage oscillations caused by repeated low voltage ride through (LVRT) of wind turbine through steady-state power flow calculation. Then, based on the switched system theory, considering the external connected impedance and internal control dynamics of the wind turbine, the switched system model for the grid-side converter (GSC) of wind turbine is established. After that, the relevant parameters are substituted to analyze the dynamic evolution process of each electrical quantity during the process that wind turbine repeatedly enters and exits LVRT, revealing the evolution mechanism of voltage oscillations. Finally, the voltage oscillation phenomenon of the grid-connected point of wind turbine is reproduced through simulation, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical analysis results. Furthermore, the main factors which influence characteristics of voltage oscillations are explored as well."}

Locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) accounts for approximately two-thirds of GC diagnoses, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has emerged as the standard treatment for LAGC. However, the effectiveness of NACT varies significantly among patients, with a considerable subset displaying treatment resistance. Ineffective NACT not only leads to adverse effects but also misses the optimal therapeutic window, resulting in lower survival rate. However, existing multimodal learning methods assume the availability of all modalities for each patient, which does not align with the reality of clinical practice. The limited availability of modalities for each patient would cause information loss, adversely affecting predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an incomplete multimodal data integration framework for GC (iMD4GC) to address the challenges posed by incomplete multimodal data, enabling precise response prediction and survival analysis. Specifically, iMD4GC incorporates unimodal attention layers for each modality to capture intra-modal information. Subsequently, the cross-modal interaction layers explore potential inter-modal interactions and capture complementary information across modalities, thereby enabling information compensation for missing modalities. To evaluate iMD4GC, we collected three multimodal datasets for GC study: GastricRes (698 cases) for response prediction, GastricSur (801 cases) for survival analysis, and TCGA-STAD (400 cases) for survival analysis. The scale of our datasets is significantly larger than previous studies. The iMD4GC achieved impressive performance with an 80.2% AUC on GastricRes, 71.4% C-index on GastricSur, and 66.1% C-index on TCGA-STAD, significantly surpassing other compared methods."}

Ghanem, Christina Bonfert, Robert Schober", "subjects": "Signal Processing (eess.SP)", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate joint 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory planning and resource allocation for rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing. To support emerging real-time SAR applications and enable live mission control, we incorporate real-time communication with a ground station (GS). The UAV's main mission is the mapping of large areas of interest (AoIs) using an onboard SAR system and transferring the unprocessed raw radar data to the ground in real time. We propose a robust trajectory and resource allocation design that takes into account random UAV trajectory deviations. To this end, we model the UAV trajectory deviations and study their effect on the radar coverage. Then, we formulate a robust non-convex mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) such that the UAV 3D trajectory and resources are jointly optimized for maximization of the radar ground coverage. A low-complexity sub-optimal solution for the formulated problem is presented. Furthermore, to assess the performance of the sub-optimal algorithm, we derive an upper bound on the optimal solution based on monotonic optimization theory. Simulation results show that the proposed sub-optimal algorithm achieves close-to-optimal performance and not only outperforms several benchmark schemes but is also robust with respect to UAV trajectory deviations."}

Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience."}
