We first prove a structure theorem on such polynomials. We show that the highest degree term $P_m$ must factor as $P_0^kQ_m$ where $k$ is odd, $Q_m\\ge 0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $P_0$ is irreducible, and that the level sets of $P_m$ are all area minimizing. Moreover, the unique tangent cone of $\\operatorname{graph} P$ at $\\infty$ is $\\{P_0=0\\}\\times\\mathbb{R}$. If $k\\ge 3$, we know further that lower order terms down to some degree are divisible by $P_0$. We also show that $P$ must contain terms of both high and low degree. In particular, it cannot be homogeneous. As a corollary, we prove that there is no quadratic or cubic polynomial solution. Using a general decay lower bound of Green's functions on minimal hypersurfaces we are able to show that $\\operatorname{deg} P_0+k^{-1}\\operatorname{deg} Q_m\\le n-2$. Finally, we prove that a polynomial minimal graph cannot have $C\\times \\mathbb{R}^l$ as its tangent cone at $\\infty$ where $l\\ge 1$ and $C$ is any isoparametric cone. We also show that the existence of a nonlinear polynomial solutions on $\\mathbb{R}^8$ will imply the existence of an area minimizing but not strictly minimizing cubic cone in $\\mathbb{R}^8$. These results indicate that finding an explicit polynomial solution can be hard."}

For converging multiplicity 1 stationary varifolds, we have $L^p$ convergence of the Green's functions, but there are examples of stationary varifolds on which the lower bounds and asymptotics may fail. An application of the lower bound will be given in [9]."}

In this paper, we construct, for each given $\\epsilon >0$, a sequence of $(n+2)$-dimensional manifolds $(M_{i} ,g_i ) \\stackrel{GH}{\\longrightarrow} (X_\\epsilon ,d_\\epsilon ) $ with ${\\rm Ric}_{g_i} > \\lambda $, such that $d_{GH} (X,X_\\epsilon ) \\leq \\epsilon $, and $X_\\epsilon $ is homeomorphic to the space obtained by removing an infinite number of balls from $X$. Hence $X_\\epsilon $ has dense boundary with an infinite number of connected components. Moreover, $X_\\epsilon $ has no open subset which is topologically a manifold. This generalizes Hupp-Naber-Wang's result (arxiv: 2308.03909) from $4$-dimensional case to the general case of dimension $n\\geq 3$. Notably, the restriction $n\\geq 3$ is essential, as Ricci limit spaces in $1$ and $2$ dimensions always have a dense open subset which is topologically a manifold. Our construction differs from that of Hupp-Naber-Wang. In their approach, Hupp-Naber-Wang considered doing an infinite number of blow-ups on the local complex surface structure of $X$, thus relying on the $4$-dimensional condition. However, our method involves removing an infinite number of balls from $X$, allowing us to construct in the general case of dimensions greater than or equal to $3$. As a corollary, we provide a solution to an open problem posed by Naber in the $3$-dimensional case. Note that the $3$-dimensional case is the only remaining unresolved case in Naber's problem. Consequently, Naber's question is resolved in all dimensions."}

Fix a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $A$ on $L$, and let $D_L$ be the associated spin$^c$ Dirac operator. Let $R^{tw}_{g,A}:=R_g + 2ic(\\Omega)$ be the twisted scalar curvature (which takes values in the endomorphims of the spinor bundle), where $R_g$ is the scalar curvature of $g$ and $2ic(\\Omega)$ comes from the curvature $2$-form $\\Omega$ of the connection $A$. Then the Lichnerowicz-Schr\\\"odinger formula for the square of the Dirac operator takes the form $D_L^2 =\\nabla^*\\nabla+\\frac{1}{4}R^{tw}_{g,A}$. In a previous work we proved that a closed non-spin simply-connected spin$^c$-manifold $(M,L)$ of dimension $n\\geq 5$ admits a pair $(g,A)$ such that $R^{tw}_{g,A}>0$ if and only if the index $\\alpha^c(M,L):=\\text{ind}\\, D_L$ vanishes in $K_n$. In this paper we introduce a scalar-valued generalized scalar curvature $R^{gen}_{g,A}:=R_g - 2|\\Omega|_{op}$, where $|\\Omega|_{op}$ is the pointwise operator norm of Clifford multiplication $c(\\Omega)$, acting on spinors. We show that the positivity condition on the operator $R^{tw}_{g,A}$ is equivalent to the positivity of the scalar function $R^{gen}_{g,A}$. We prove a corresponding trichotomy theorem concerning the curvature $R^{gen}_{g,A}$, and study its implications. We also show that the space $\\mathcal{R}^{gen+}(M,L)$ of pairs $(g,A)$ with $R^{gen}_{g,A}>0$ has non-trivial topology, and address a conjecture about non-triviality of the ``index difference'' map."}

This implies the Gauss' theorema egregium, which says that the Gaussian curvature just depends on angles, distances, and their rates of change. In most of the textbooks, the Gauss' theorema egregium was proved as a corollary to the derivation of the Gauss equations, a set of equations expressing $EK, FK$ and $GK$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols can be expressed in terms of $E$, $F$ and $G$. In principle, one can derive the Brioschi formula from the Gauss equations after some tedious calculations. In this note, we give a direct elementary proof of the Brioschi formula without using Christoffel symbols. The key to the proof are properties of matrices and determinants."}
