Nevertheless, it is not able to compensate for the effects produced by modeling errors or disturbances. A solution to improve the feedforward performance is the use of an adaptation law that modifies the parameters of the feedforward control. In the case where real-time feedback is not possible, a solution is a run-to-run numerical optimization method that is fed with a cost based on a measured signal. Although the effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated, its performance is hindered by slow convergence. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on Pattern Search and Adaptive Coordinate Descent methods that makes use of the sensitivity of the feedforward controller to its parameters so that the convergence speed improves significantly. Like many algorithms, this is a local strategy so the algorithm might converge to a local minimum. Therefore, we present two versions, one without a learning rate and one with it. To compare them and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, simulated results are shown on a well-known control problem in electromechanics: the soft-landing control of electromechanical switching devices."}

However, research on unit commitment with AC power flow constraints has been limited to a few relatively small test networks. This work investigates large-scale AC unit commitment problems for the day-ahead market and develops decomposition algorithms capable of obtaining high-quality solutions at industry-relevant scales. The results illustrate that a simple algorithm that only seeks to satisfy unit commitment, reserve, and AC power balance constraints can obtain surprisingly high-quality solutions to this AC unit commitment problem. However, a naive strategy that prioritizes reserve feasibility leads to AC infeasibility, motivating the need to design heuristics that can effectively balance reserve and AC feasibility. Finally, this work explores a parallel decomposition strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to obtain feasible solutions on large cases within the two hour time limit required by typical day-ahead market operations."}

We also consider diffusive PDEs with or without linear convection, for which a weighted L2 norm is a CLF whose derivative has a quadratic dependence in the control input. For each structure on the derivative of the CLF, we achieve inverse optimality with respect to a meaningful cost functional. For the case where the derivative of the CLF has a depressed cubic dependence in the control, we construct a cost functional for which the unique minimizer is the unique real root of a cubic polynomial: the Cardano-Lyapunov controller. When the derivative of the CLF is quadratic in the control, we construct a cost functional that is minimized by two distinct feedback laws, that correspond to the two distinct real roots of a quadratic equation. We show how to switch from one root to the other to reduce the control effort."}

However, fairness concerns arise as certain PV plants may experience more significant curtailments than others depending on their locations within the network. Existing literature tackles this issue through fairness-promoting/aware optimization schemes. These schemes can be broadly categorized into two types. The first type maximizes an additional fairness objective along with the main objective of curtailment minimization. The second type is formulated as a feedback controller, where fairness is accounted for by assigning different weights (as feedback) in the curtailment minimization objective for each PV plant based on previous curtailment actions. In this work, we combine these two schemes and provide extensive analyses and comparisons of these two fairness schemes. We compare the performance in terms of fairness and net curtailments for several benchmark test networks."}

Specifically, we first leverage a previously developed network flow model to compute the I-AMoD system operation in a minimum-time manner. Second, we formally define accessibility unfairness, and use it to frame the maximum-accessibility-fairness problem and cast it as a linear program. We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution. Thereby we observe that the accessibility fairness of individual paths is, on average, worse than the average values obtained from flows, setting the stage for a discussion on the definition of accessibility fairness itself."}

To curb the significant increase in the dimensionality of the resulting full-order Koopman models caused by the use of lifting functions, we propose a reduced-order Koopman modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition. A computationally efficient linear robust predictive control scheme is established based on the reduced-order Koopman model.

The hierarchical controller outperforms, reducing door-opening temperature drops by 46.96% and 51.33% compared to single layer MPC and rule-based methods in the relevant section. Additionally, our strategy minimizes the maximum temperature gaps between the sections during recovery by 86.4% and 78.7%, surpassing single layer MPC and rule-based approaches, respectively.

More specifically, a hierarchical group consists of a collection of agents with double-integrator dynamics on a directed acyclic graph with additional reverse edges, which characterize feedback mechanisms across hierarchical layers. As the group size grows and the reverse edges appear, we investigate whether the absolute velocity protocol and the relative velocity protocol can preserve the system consensus property without tuning the control gains. It is rigorously proved that the absolute velocity protocol is able to achieve completely scalable second-order consensus but the relative velocity protocol cannot. This result theoretically reveals how the scalable coordination behavior in hierarchical groups is determined by local interaction rules. Moreover, we develop a hierarchical structure in order to achieve scalable second-order consensus for networks of any size and with any number of reverse edges."}

In a finite-horizon offline setting, the goal is to optimize the beam-forming design, the 3D UAV positioning and trajectory solution, and the user association/scheduling policy, to maximize the cumulative fleet-wide reward obtained by satisfying the quality-of-service mandates imposed on each user uplink request, subject to an average per-UAV mobility power constraint. With a probabilistic air-to-ground channel model, a multi-user MIMO uplink communication model with prioritized traffic, and a novel 3D mobility model for rotary-wing UAVs, the fleet-wide reward maximization problem is solved via a cross-layer optimization framework: first, K-means clustering is employed to obtain user clusters; then, equipped with a zero-forcing beam-forming design, the positions of the UAVs are optimized via two-stage grid search; next, treating these optimal positions as the graph vertices of a fully-connected mesh, the 3D UAV trajectories (i.e., graph edges) are designed via a learning based competitive swarm optimization algorithm, under an average UAV power consumption constraint, coupled with projected subgradient ascent for dual optimization; consequently, the user association/scheduling strategy is solved via a graphical branch-and-bound method on the underlying multiple traveling salesman problem. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms static UAV deployments, adaptive Voronoi decomposition techniques, and state-of-the-art iterative fleet control algorithms, with respect to user quality-of-service and per-UAV average power consumption."}

A. Scherpen, Nima Monshizadeh", "subjects": "Systems and Control (eess.SY)", "abstract": "Demand response has been a promising solution for accommodating renewable energy in power systems. In this study, we consider a demand response scheme within a distribution network facing an energy supply deficit. The utility company incentivizes load aggregators to adjust their pre-scheduled energy consumption and generation to match the supply. Each aggregator, which represents a group of prosumers, aims to maximize its revenue by bidding strategically in the demand response scheme. Since aggregators act in their own self-interest and their revenues and feasible bids influence one another, we model their competition as a network-constrained aggregative game. This model incorporates power flow constraints to prevent potential line congestion. Given that there are no coordinators and aggregators can only communicate with their neighbours, we introduce a fully distributed generalized Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm to determine the optimal bidding strategies for aggregators in this game. Within this algorithm, only estimates of the aggregate and certain auxiliary variables are communicated among neighbouring aggregators. We demonstrate the convergence of this algorithm by constructing an equivalent iteration using the forward-backward splitting technique."}

To mitigate the effects of selfish behavior, central planners can use dynamic payments to guide strategic multi-agent systems toward stability and socially optimal outcomes. However, the effectiveness of such interventions critically relies on accurately predicting agents' responses to incentives and dynamically adjusting payments so that the system is guided towards the desired outcomes. These challenges are further amplified in real-time applications where the dynamics are unknown and only scarce data is available. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce the SIAR-MPC method, combining the recently introduced Side Information Assisted Regression (SIAR) method for system identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC). SIAR utilizes side-information constraints inherent to game theoretic applications to model agent responses to payments from scarce data, while MPC uses this model to facilitate dynamic payment adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of SIAR-MPC in guiding the system towards socially optimal equilibria, stabilizing chaotic behaviors, and avoiding specified regions of the state space. Comparative analyses in data-scarce settings show SIAR-MPC's superior performance over pairing MPC with Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a powerful system identification method that finds models satisfying specific constraints."}

Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience."}
