This method divides the interior of Tile(1,1) into five convex polygons with five or more edges, and we have so far identified four methods."}

Similarly $H_n^s$ is the corresponding quantity for symmetric bodies. It is possible to define $H_n$ and $H_n^s$ in terms of illumination of the boundary of the body using external light sources, and the famous Hadwiger's covering conjecture (illumination conjecture) states that $H_n=H_{n}^s=2^n$. In this note we obtain new upper bounds on $H_n$ and $H_{n}^s$ for small dimensions $n$. Our main idea is to cover the body by translates of John's ellipsoid (the inscribed ellipsoid of the largest volume). Using specific lattice coverings, estimates of quermassintegrals for convex bodies in John's position, and calculations of mean widths of regular simplexes, we prove the following new upper bounds on $H_n$ and $H_n^s$: $H_5\\le 933$, $H_6\\le 6137$, $H_7\\le 41377$, $H_8\\le 284096$, $H_4^s\\le 72$, $H_5^s\\le 305$, and $H_6^s\\le 1292$. For larger $n$, we describe how the general asymptotic bounds $H_n\\le \\binom{2n}{n}n(\\ln n+\\ln\\ln n+5)$ and $H_n^s\\le 2^n n(\\ln n+\\ln\\ln n+5)$ due to Rogers and Shephard can be improved for specific values of $n$."}

It is shown that such mappings can be discontinuous as is the case of Chatterjea type mappings and this new class includes the class of Chatterjea type mappings. The fixed point theorem for generalized Chatterjea type mappings is proven."}

T. Rockafellar. With the exception of the one-point faces known as extreme points, faces received little attention in the theory of infinite-dimensional convexity, perhaps due to their lack of relative interior points. Circumventing this peculiarity, M. E. Shirokov and the present author explored faces generated by points. These faces possess relative interior points and they can serve as building blocks for general faces. Here we deepen this approach, taking into account ideas by E. M. Alfsen and L. E. Dubins. We also indicate possible application in probability theory."}

We find the best constant $c>0$, for which this function $h_{G,c}$ is a metric in specific choices of $G$. We give several sharp inequalities between $h_{G,c}$ and other hyperbolic type metrics, and also offer a few results related to ball inclusion."}
