Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency. This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, Our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods. Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\\% (top-5) and 5.4\\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline."}

Previous methods largely ignored the fact that not all amino acids are equally important for protein folding and activity. In this article, we propose a neural clustering framework that can automatically discover the critical components of a protein by considering both its primary and tertiary structure information. Our framework treats a protein as a graph, where each node represents an amino acid and each edge represents a spatial or sequential connection between amino acids. We then apply an iterative clustering strategy to group the nodes into clusters based on their 1D and 3D positions and assign scores to each cluster. We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering, until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein. We evaluate on four protein-related tasks: protein fold classification, enzyme reaction classification, gene ontology term prediction, and enzyme commission number prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Despite various methodologies explored to quantify bradykinesia, computer vision-based approaches have shown promising results. However, these methods often fall short in adequately addressing key bradykinesia characteristics in repetitive limb movements: \"occasional arrest\" and \"decrement in amplitude.\" This research advances vision-based quantification of bradykinesia by introducing nuanced numerical analysis to capture decrement in amplitudes and employing a simple deep learning technique, LSTM-FCN, for precise classification of occasional arrests. Our approach structures the classification process hierarchically, tailoring it to the unique dynamics of bradykinesia in PD. Statistical analysis of the extracted features, including those representing arrest and fatigue, has demonstrated their statistical significance in most cases. This finding underscores the importance of considering \"occasional arrest\" and \"decrement in amplitude\" in bradykinesia quantification of limb movement. Our enhanced diagnostic tool has been rigorously tested on an extensive dataset comprising 1396 motion videos from 310 PD patients, achieving an accuracy of 80.3%. The results confirm the robustness and reliability of our method."}
