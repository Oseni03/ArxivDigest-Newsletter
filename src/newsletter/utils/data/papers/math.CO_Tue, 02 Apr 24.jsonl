Ellis-Monaghan", "subjects": "Combinatorics (math.CO)", "abstract": "In 1965 Edmonds showed that every eulerian graph has a bi-eulerian embedding, i.e., an embedding with exactly two faces, each bounded by an euler circuit. We refine this result by giving conditions for a graph to have a bi-eulerian embedding that is specifically orientable or nonorientable. We give connections to the maximum genus problem for directed embeddings of digraphs, in which every face is bounded by a directed circuit. Given an eulerian digraph $D$ with all vertices of degree 2 mod 4 and a directed euler circuit $T$ of $D$, we show that $D$ has an orientable bi-eulerian directed embedding with one of the faces bounded by $T$; this is a maximum genus directed embedding. This result also holds when $D$ has exactly two vertices of degree $0$ mod $4$, provided they are interlaced by $T$. More generally, if $D$ has $\\ell$ vertices of degree 0 mod 4, we can find an orientable directed embedding with a face bounded by $T$ and with at most $\\ell+1$ other faces. We show that given an eulerian graph $G$ and a circuit decomposition $C$ of $G$, there is an nonorientable embedding of $G$ with the elements of $C$ bounding faces and with one additional face bounded by an euler circuit, unless every block of $G$ is a cycle and $C$ is the collection of cycles of $G$. In particular, every eulerian graph that is not edgeless or a cycle has a nonorientable bi-eulerian embedding with a given euler circuit $T$ bounding one of the faces. Polynomial-time algorithms giving the specified embeddings are implicit in our proofs."}

We introduce a novel connection called product connection and prove that the connection heat kernel on arbitrary high dimensional lattice with product connection equals the Kronecker sum of one dimensional connection lattices' connection heat kernels. Furthermore, if the connection graph is consistent, we substantiate the interrelation between its connection heat kernel and its underlying graph's heat kernel. We define a connection called quotient connection such that discrete torus with quotient connection can be considered as a quotient graph of connection lattice, whose connection heat kernel is demonstrated to be the sum of connection lattices' connection heat kernels.

Their fractal nature has also found relevance in antenna design, image compression, and the study of porous materials. The hypercube is a prevalent interconnection network architecture known for its symmetry, vertex transitivity, regularity, recursive structure, high connectedness, and simple routing. Various variations of hypercubes have emerged in literature to meet the demands of practical applications. Sometimes, they are the spanning subgraphs of it. This study examines the generalized Sierpi\\'{n}ski graphs over $C_4$, which are spanning subgraphs of hypercubes and determines the metric dimension and their variants. This is in contrast to hypercubes, where these properties are inherently complicated. Along the way, the role of twin vertices in the theory of metric dimensions is further elaborated."}

As corollaries, we obtain strengthenings of two results by Chen et al.: a minimum degree condition guaranteeing the existence of a spanning jellyfish, and an Ore-type sufficient condition for the existence of a spanning broom. The corollaries are sharp for infinitely many $n$. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a modification of the Hopping Lemma due to Woodall."}
