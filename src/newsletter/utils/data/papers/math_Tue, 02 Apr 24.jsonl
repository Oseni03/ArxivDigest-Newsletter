By using a swarm of agents, local minima will not be taken account and the global minimum will be found. Furthermore leads the communication between the agent to a further expansion of the search region. Under the supervision of Prof. Angela Kunoth, I give an introduction to this swarm-based method in my bachelor thesis.

Therefore, in this paper we develop a novel algorithm derived from a realistic, correlated model of relative pose uncertainty, and we quantify the resulting improvement in the accuracy of the solutions we obtain relative to state-of-the-art PGO algorithms. Our approach utilizes Riemannian optimization on the planar unit dual quaternion (PUDQ) manifold, and we prove that it converges to first-order stationary points of a Lie-theoretic maximum likelihood objective.

We establish the uniform (asymptotic) optimality of the base-stock policy when both demand and patience distributions are known. When the backlogged demands become unobservable, we introduce a novel policy family that operates without backlogged demands information, and prove that it can approach the cost efficiency of the optimal policy in the system when the demand and patience distributions are known. Finally, we consider an online inventory control problem in which backlogged demand is unobservable and demand and patience distributions are also not known, and develop a UCB-type algorithm that yields a near-optimal policy. The regret bounds given by the algorithm are provably tight within the planning horizon, and are comparable to the state-of-the-art results in the literature, even in the face of partial and biased observations and weaker system ergodicity."}

A key feature of this framework is the ability to explicitly utilize user-specified uncertainty priors, which we call model-specific local trust estimates, that are provided directly together with the problem specification and exploited in adaptive sampling strategies. A multi-fidelity model hierarchy is supported to allow trade-offs in accuracy and data acquisition cost while exploring the search space given a specified budget of potentially distributed, heterogeneous resources.

The model consists of a dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) based route choice and a link transmission model (LTM) for network loading. The formulated DUE adopts a pedestrian volume delay function (pVDF) taking into account the properties of bidirectional pedestrian streams such as self-organization. The adopted LTM uses a three-dimensional triangular bidirectional fundamental diagram as well as a generalized first-order node model.

A critical question the league must address when re-opening is how to appropriately select a subset of the remaining games to conclude the season in a shortened time frame. Academic/practical relevance: Despite the rich literature on scheduling an entire season starting from a blank slate, concluding an existing season is quite different. Our approach attempts to achieve team rankings similar to that which would have resulted had the season been played out in full. Methodology: We propose a data-driven model which exploits predictive and prescriptive analytics to produce a schedule for the remainder of the season comprised of a subset of originally-scheduled games. Our model introduces novel rankings-based objectives within a stochastic optimization model, whose parameters are first estimated using a predictive model. We introduce a deterministic equivalent reformulation along with a tailored Frank-Wolfe algorithm to efficiently solve our problem, as well as a robust counterpart based on min-max regret. Results: We present simulation-based numerical experiments from previous National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons 2004--2019, and show that our models are computationally efficient, outperform a greedy benchmark that approximates a non-rankings-based scheduling policy, and produce interpretable results. Managerial implications: Our data-driven decision-making framework may be used to produce a shortened season with 25-50\\% fewer games while still producing an end-of-season ranking similar to that of the full season, had it been played."}

Firstly, a novel sparse identification algorithm is proposed, which can generate sparse estimates based on least squares estimation by adaptively adjusting the threshold. Secondly, under a possibly weakest non-persistent excited condition, we prove that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the zero and nonzero elements of the sparse parameter vector using a finite number of observations, and further estimates of the nonzero elements almost surely converge to the true values. Compared with the related works, e.g., LASSO, our method only requires the weakest assumptions and does not require solving additional optimization problems. Besides, our theoretical results do not require any statistical assumptions on the regression signals, including independence or stationarity, which makes our results promising for application to stochastic feedback systems. Thirdly, the number of finite observations that guarantee the convergence of the zero-element set of unknown sparse parameters of the Hammerstein system is derived for the first time. Finally, numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Since there is no additional optimization problem, i.e., no additional numerical error, the proposed algorithm performs much better than other related algorithms."}

In the classical realm of Riemannian geometry, informally, if two manifolds are close in the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and belong to a class of manifolds with bounded curvature and diameter, then the spectra of their Laplacian or Dirac operators are also close under many scenari. Of particular interest is the case where a sequence of manifolds converge for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance to a manifold of lower dimension, and the question of the continuity, in some sense, of the spectra of geometrically relevant operators. In this paper, we initiate the study of the continuity of spectra and other properties of metric spectral triples under collapse in the noncommutative realm. As a first step in this study, we work with collapse for the spectral propinquity, an analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for spectral triples introduced by the second author, i.e. a form of metric for differential structures. Inspired by results from collapse in Riemannian geometry, we begin with the study of spectral triples which decompose, in some sense, in a vertical and a horizontal direction, and we collapse these spectral triples along the vertical direction. We obtain convergence results, and by the work of the second author, we conclude continuity results for the spectra of the Dirac operators of these spectral triples. Examples include collapse of product of spectral triples with one Abelian factor, $U(1)$ principal bundles over Riemannian spin manifolds, and noncommutative principal bundles, including C*-crossed-products and other noncommutative bundles."}

Consequently, these diagrams facilitate a clearer visual comprehension of diverse theoretical and applied systems. Complex algebraic structures - otherwise represented by a forest of symbols - can be encoded into diagrams with intuitive graphical rules. The prevailing paradigm for diagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification reflects the axioms of monoidal categories. However, such diagrams struggle in accurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or natural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or the simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products. In this work, we introduce functor string diagrams, a systematic approach for the development of categorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and products to be clearly represented. We validate their practicality in multiple dimensions. We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving the Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence their helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility by leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at last, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously expressed."}

In addition, we investigate the Riemannian manifold associated with the geometric mean for T-positive definite tensors, considering it as a totally geodesic embedded submanifold of the Riemannian manifold associated with the case of matrices.

However, critical challenge lies in maintaining robust detection performance while operating within the constraints of limited bandwidth and energy resources. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines model-driven deep learning (DL) with binary quantization to strike a balance between communication overhead and detection performance in WSNs. We begin by establishing the lower bound of detection error probability for distributed detection using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Furthermore, we prove the global optimality of employing identical local quantizers across sensors, thereby maximizing the corresponding Chernoff information. Subsequently, the paper derives the minimum MAP detection error probability (MAPDEP) by inplementing identical binary probabilistic quantizers across the sensors. Moreover, the paper establishes the equivalence between utilizing all quantized data and their average as input to the detector at the fusion center (FC). In particular, we derive the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures the difference between the true posterior probability and output of the proposed detector. Leveraging the MAPDEP and KL divergence as loss functions, the paper proposes model-driven DL method to separately train the probability controller module in the quantizer and the detector module at the FC.

The quantities of interest are typically defined on the lower-dimensional position space and estimated on a grid (histogram). In several applications, such as the construction of diffusion Monte Carlo-like techniques and variance prediction for particle tracing Monte Carlo methods, the cell escape probabilities, i.e., the probabilities with which particles escape a grid cell during one step of the Markov process, are of interest. In this paper, we derive formulas to calculate the cell escape probabilities for common mesh elements in one, two, and three dimensions. Deterministic calculation of cell escape probabilities in higher dimensions becomes expensive and prone to quadrature errors due to the involved high-dimensional integrals. We therefore also introduce a stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the escape probabilities, which is more robust at the cost of a statistical error.

We give connections to the maximum genus problem for directed embeddings of digraphs, in which every face is bounded by a directed circuit. Given an eulerian digraph $D$ with all vertices of degree 2 mod 4 and a directed euler circuit $T$ of $D$, we show that $D$ has an orientable bi-eulerian directed embedding with one of the faces bounded by $T$; this is a maximum genus directed embedding. This result also holds when $D$ has exactly two vertices of degree $0$ mod $4$, provided they are interlaced by $T$. More generally, if $D$ has $\\ell$ vertices of degree 0 mod 4, we can find an orientable directed embedding with a face bounded by $T$ and with at most $\\ell+1$ other faces. We show that given an eulerian graph $G$ and a circuit decomposition $C$ of $G$, there is an nonorientable embedding of $G$ with the elements of $C$ bounding faces and with one additional face bounded by an euler circuit, unless every block of $G$ is a cycle and $C$ is the collection of cycles of $G$.

A counterexample is derived in the form of an exponentially increasing travelling wave solution of the linearized equation, indicating a possible explanation of traveling bands, which have been observed in the literature in simulations with an individual based model. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation.

The proposed method is particularly effective in solving classes of variational problems, specifically monotone inclusion problems, commonly encountered in image processing tasks. The Forward-Backward-Forward (FBF) algorithm is employed to address these problems, offering a solution even when the Lipschitz constant of the neural network is unknown. Notably, the FBF algorithm provides convergence guarantees under the condition that the learned operator is monotone. Building on plug-and-play methodologies, our objective is to apply these newly learned operators to solving non-linear inverse problems. To achieve this, we initially formulate the problem as a variational inclusion problem. Subsequently, we train a monotone neural network to approximate an operator that may not inherently be monotone. Leveraging the FBF algorithm, we then show simulation examples where the non-linear inverse problem is successfully solved."}

First, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretisation that has the benefit of decoupling the equations. We prove the positivity, boundedness, and convergence of the time-discrete solutions to the time-continuous solution. Then, we introduce an iterative linearisation scheme to solve the resulting nonlinear time-discrete problems. Under weak assumptions on the time-step size, we prove that the scheme converges irrespective of the space discretisation and mesh. Moreover, if the problem is non-degenerate, the convergence becomes faster as the time-step size decreases.

The regularity estimates that we obtain are quantitative and constructive (all computable constants), and have a local character, allowing us to show further properties of the solutions: for instance, initial singularities do not move with time. We also study the asymptotic behavior for large times of solutions to Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Our results are new also in the linear case and are sharp when $p$ is integer. We expect them to be optimal for all $p>1$, supporting this claim with some numerical simulations."}

This model is the subject of Sklyanin's Functional Bethe Ansatz. We develop in this paper the whole technique of the FBA which includes: 1. Construction of eigenstates of an off-diagonal element of a monodromy matrix. Most important ingredients of these eigenstates are the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients of the corresponding representation. 2. Separately, we discuss the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients, as well as the Wigner's 6j symbols, in details. The later are rather well known in the theory of $3D$ indices. Thus, the Sklyanin basis of the quantum separation of variables is constructed. The matrix elements of an eigenstate of the auxiliary transfer matrix in this basis are products of functions satisfying the Baxter equation. Such functions are called usually the $Q$-operators. We investigate the Baxter equation and $Q$-operators from two points of view. 3. In the model considered the most convenient Bethe-type variables are the zeros of a Wronskian of two well defined particular solutions of the Baxter equation. This approach works perfectly in the thermodynamic limit. We calculate the distribution of these roots in the thermodynamic limit, and so we reproduce in this way the partition function of the model. 4. The real parameter $q$, which is the standard quantum group parameter, plays the role of the absolute temperature in the model considered. Expansion with respect to $q$ (tropical expansion) gives an alternative way to establish the structure of the eigenstates. In this way we classify the elementary excitations over the ground state."}

The approach begins with a two-parameter continuation along which a tool based on the theory of Poincar\\'e index is employed to identify the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Using the approximate cusp location, Newton's method is then applied to a given augmented system (the cusp map), yielding a more precise numerical approximation of the cusp. Through a successful application of a Newton-Kantorovich type theorem, we establish the existence of a non-degenerate zero of the cusp map in the vicinity of the numerical approximation. Employing a Gershgorin circles argument, we then prove that exactly one eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix at the cusp candidate has zero real part, thus rigorously confirming the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Finally, by incorporating explicit control over the cusp's location, a rigorous enclosure for the normal form coefficient is obtained, providing the explicit dynamics on the center manifold at the cusp. We show the effectiveness of this method by applying it to four distinct models."}

Holding costs accrue as customers wait in the queue, while transfer decisions incur both fixed (setup) and variable costs proportional to the number and direction of transfers. Our work is primarily motivated by inter-facility patient transfers between hospitals during a surge in demand for hospitalization (e.g., during a pandemic). By analyzing an associated fluid control problem, we show that under fairly general assumptions including time-varying arrivals and convex increasing holding costs, the optimal policy in each period partitions the state-space into a well-defined $\\textit{no-transfer region}$ and its complement, such that transferring is optimal if and only if the system is sufficiently imbalanced. In the absence of fixed transfer costs, an optimal policy moves the state to the no-transfer region's boundary; in contrast, with fixed costs, the state is moved to the no-transfer region's relative interior. We further leverage the fluid control problem to provide insights on the trade-off between holding and transfer costs, emphasizing the importance of preventing excessive idleness when transfers are not feasible in continuous-time. Using simulation experiments, we investigate the performance and robustness of the fluid policy for the stochastic system. In particular, our case study calibrated using data during the pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area demonstrates that transferring patients between hospitals could result in up to 27.7% reduction in total cost with relatively few transfers."}

This paper studies networked HE microgrids planning (NHEMP), considering a critical but often-overlooked issue, i.e., the demand-inducing effect (DIE) associated with infrastructure development decisions. Specifically, higher refueling capacities will attract more refueling demand of hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). To capture such interactions between investment decisions and induced refueling demand, we introduce a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set and build a trilevel stochastic-robust formulation. The upper-level determines optimal investment strategies for HE microgrids, the lower-level optimizes the risk-aware operation schedules across a series of stochastic scenarios, and, for each scenario, the middle-level identifies the \"worst\" situation of refueling demand within an individual DDU set to ensure economic feasibility. Then, an adaptive and exact decomposition algorithm, based on Parametric Column-and-Constraint Generation (PC&CG), is customized and developed to address the computational challenge and to quantitatively analyze the impact of DIE. Case studies on an IEEE exemplary system validate the effectiveness of the proposed NHEMP model and the PC&CG algorithm. It is worth highlighting that DIE can make an important contribution to the economic benefits of NHEMP, yet its significance will gradually decrease when the main bottleneck transits to other system restrictions."}

Beyond this threshold, the dynamics do not display chaotic behavior. Furthermore, we derive a chaotic operator for the Riemann zeta function within the critical strip, utilizing the correction term from the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula. We establish the chaotic nature and Hermiticity of this operator, and discuss its diagonalization properties. Moreover, our study reveals a remarkable compatibility between our derived chaotic operator and the quantum hydrogen model, as evidenced by the analysis of its eigenvalues resembling the energy levels of hydrogen. Numerical evidence, including Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation analysis, and entropy computation, underscores the unpredictability of the system.

To this end, we investigate the average mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem for the HRIS-aided massive MIMO system by jointly optimizing the BS receive antenna selection matrix, the reflection phase coefficients, the reflection amplitude matrix, and the mode selection matrix of the HRIS under the power budget of the HRIS. To tackle the non-convexity and intractability of this problem, we first transform the binary and discrete variables into continuous ones, and then propose a penalty-based exact block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve these subproblems alternately.

A common issue arises from defectors seeking to obtain an excessive share of these resources for personal gain, potentially leading to resource depletion. To mitigate this tragedy and ensure sustainable development of resources, implementing mechanisms to either reward those who adhere to distribution rules or penalize those who do not, appears advantageous. We introduce two models: a tax-reward model and a tax-punishment model, to address this issue. Our analysis reveals that in the tax-reward model, the evolutionary trajectory of the system is influenced not only by the tax revenue collected but also by the natural growth rate of the resources. Conversely, the tax-punishment model exhibits distinct characteristics when compared to the tax-reward model, notably the potential for bistability. In such scenarios, the selection of initial conditions is critical, as it can determine the system's path. Furthermore, our study identifies instances where the system lacks stable points, exemplified by a limit cycle phenomenon, underscoring the complexity and dynamism inherent in managing public resources using these models."}

To curtail deployment expenses and power consumption for mmWave band operations, each AP incorporates a hybrid digital-analog structure encompassing precoder/combiner functions. However, this incorporation introduces processing intricacies within channel estimation and precoding/combining design. In this paper, we first present a hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing framework and derive explicit expressions for both uplink and downlink achievable rates. Then we formulate a power allocation problem to maximize the weighted bidirectional sum rates. To tackle this non-convex problem, we develop a collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm called multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) for NAFD cell-free mmWave networks. Specifically, given the tightly coupled nature of both uplink and downlink power coefficients in NAFD cell-free mmWave networks, the MATD3 algorithm resolves such coupled conflicts through an interactive learning process between agents and the environment. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation methods within our hybrid MIMO processing paradigm, and demonstrate that our MATD3 algorithm outperforms both multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and conventional power allocation strategies."}

DSTP leverages dynamic methods to identify available spatial-temporal resources in the lane, utilizing signal timing, road information, and vehicle data. A Right-of-Way assignment optimization model is then developed based on these resources to determine which vehicles can enter the bus lane. The model is dynamically enacted using a rolling horizon scheme to accommodate time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies have validated the advantages of DSTP, showing maintained bus priority, improved traffic efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, and lower CO2 emissions, especially during periods of high traffic demand and concentrated bus arrivals."}

In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$.

However, the practical application of weighted least squares is challenging due to its reliance on the unknown error covariance matrix. Although feasible weighted least squares estimates, which use an approximation of this matrix, often outperform the ordinary least squares estimate in terms of efficiency, this is not always the case. In some situations, feasible weighted least squares can be less efficient than ordinary least squares. This study identifies the conditions under which feasible weighted least squares estimates using fixed weights demonstrate greater efficiency than the ordinary least squares estimate. These conditions provide guidance for the design of feasible estimates using random weights.

The optimization utilizes a combination of information on routes from OSM, utility rate design data across the United States, and freight volume data, to determine these values. In order to deal with the computational complexity of this problem, we formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem that is scalable to a large geographic area. In our analysis, we further evaluate various scenarios of utility rate design (energy charges) and EV penetration rate across different geographic regions and their impact on the operating cost and emissions of the freight trucks. Our approach determines the net emissions reduction benefits of freight electrification by considering the primary energy source in different regions. Such analysis will provide insights to policy makers in designing utility rates for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) operators depending upon the specific geographic region and to electric utilities in deciding infrastructure upgrades based on the spatial distribution of the added energy demand of M&HD EVs. To showcase the results, a case study for the U.S. state of Texas is conducted."}

When $\\delta(G)< n/2$, this cannot be guaranteed, but the existence of some other specific subgraphs can be provided. Gargano, Hell, Stacho and Vaccaro proved that every connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\\delta(G)\\geq (n-1)/3$ contains a spanning {\\em spider}, i.e., a spanning tree with at most one vertex of degree at least $3$. Later, Chen, Ferrara, Hu, Jacobson and Liu proved the stronger (and exact) result that for $n\\geq 56$ every connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\\delta(G)\\geq (n-2)/3$ contains a spanning {\\em broom}, i.e., a spanning spider obtained by joining the center of a star to an endpoint of a path. They also showed that a $2$-connected graph $G$ with $\\delta(G)\\geq (n-2)/3$ and some additional properties contains a spanning {\\em jellyfish} which is a graph obtained by gluing the center of a star to a vertex in a cycle disjoint from that star. Note that every spanning jellyfish contains a spanning broom. The goal of this paper is to prove an exact Ore-type bound which guarantees the existence of a spanning jellyfish: We prove that if $G$ is a $2$-connected graph on $n$ vertices such that every non-adjacent pair of vertices $(u,v)$ satisfies $d(u) + d(v) \\geq \\frac{2n-3}{3}$, then $G$ has a spanning jellyfish. As corollaries, we obtain strengthenings of two results by Chen et al.: a minimum degree condition guaranteeing the existence of a spanning jellyfish, and an Ore-type sufficient condition for the existence of a spanning broom. The corollaries are sharp for infinitely many $n$. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a modification of the Hopping Lemma due to Woodall."}

Recent experimental developments enable the study of replication dynamics at the single-molecule level for complete genomes, facilitating a deeper understanding of its main parameters. In these new data, replication dynamics is reported by the incorporation of an exogenous chemical, whose intra-cellular concentration follows a nonlinear function. The analysis of replication traces thus gives rise to a nonlinear inverse problem, presenting a nonconvex optimization challenge. We demonstrate that under noiseless conditions, the replication dynamics can be uniquely identified by the proposed model. Computing a global solution to this optimization problem is specially challenging because of its multiple local minima. We present the DNA-inverse optimization method that is capable of finding this global solution even in the presence of noise. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art optimization methods highlights the superior computational efficiency of our approach. DNA-inverse enables the automatic recovery of all configurations of the replication dynamics, which was not possible with previous methods."}

This paper considers the problem of joint communication and computation resource management in a two-stage edge learning system. In this system, model pre-training is first conducted at an edge server via centralized learning on local pre-stored general data, and then task-specific fine-tuning is performed at edge devices based on the pre-trained model via federated edge learning. For the two-stage learning model, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the average squared gradient norm bound), which characterizes the impacts of various system parameters such as the number of learning rounds and batch sizes in the two stages on the convergence rate. Based on our analytical results, we then propose a joint communication and computation resource management design to minimize an average squared gradient norm bound, subject to constraints on the transmit power, overall system energy consumption, and training delay. The decision variables include the number of learning rounds, batch sizes, clock frequencies, and transmit power control for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design. It is shown that the proposed joint resource management over the pre-training and fine-tuning stages well balances the system performance trade-off among the training accuracy, delay, and energy consumption. The proposed design is also shown to effectively leverage the inherent trade-off between pre-training and fine-tuning, which arises from the differences in data distribution between pre-stored general data versus real-time task-specific data, thus efficiently optimizing overall system performance."}

Here we explore another promising solution in which diffusion models are used to formulate a robust nonlinear ensemble filter for sequential data assimilation. Unlike standard machine learning methods, the proposed \\textit{Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF)} is completely training-free and can efficiently generate a set of analysis ensemble members. In this study, we apply the EnSF to a surface quasi-geostrophic model and compare its performance against the popular Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), which makes Gaussian assumptions on the posterior distribution. Numerical tests demonstrate that EnSF maintains stable performance in the absence of localization and for a variety of experimental settings. We find that EnSF achieves competitive performance relative to LETKF in the case of linear observations, but leads to significant advantages when the state is nonlinearly observed and the numerical model is subject to unexpected shocks. A spectral decomposition of the analysis results shows that the largest improvements over LETKF occur at large scales (small wavenumbers) where LETKF lacks sufficient ensemble spread. Overall, this initial application of EnSF to a geophysical model of intermediate complexity is very encouraging, and motivates further developments of the algorithm for more realistic problems."}

One of the main challenges in this method is that the QPs could easily become infeasible under safety and spatio-temporal constraints with tight control bounds. In our own recent work, we defined Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive CBFs (AVCBFs) to improve the feasibility of the CBF-based QP, while avoiding extensive parameter tuning. In this paper, we consider spatio-temporal constraints as finite-time reachability requirements. In order to satisfy these requirements, we generalize AVCBFs to Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions (AVCLBFs) that work for systems and constraints with arbitrary relative degrees. We show that our method has fewer conflicts with safety and input constraints, and outperforms the state of the art in term of adaptivity and feasibility in solving the QP.

The review systematically classifies the extant methodologies for RMDP formulation into three principal categories: parametric, moment-based, and discrepancy-based approaches, and comprehensively dissects them. The review further delves into the rectangular assumption, which is essential for the computational tractability of RMDPs yet noted for its potential to engender overly conservative policy outcomes. The review summarizes three popular rectangular forms and presents new proof attesting to the NP-hardness of non-rectangular RMDPs.

Eldar, Rui Zhang", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)", "abstract": "In this correspondence, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user hybrid beamforming scheme with a sub-connected structure, where multiple movable sub-arrays can independently change their positions within different local regions. To maximize the system sum rate, we jointly optimize the digital beamformer, analog beamformer, and positions of subarrays, under the constraints of unit modulus, finite movable regions, and power budget. Due to the non-concave/non-convex objective function/constraints, as well as the highly coupled variables, the formulated problem is challenging to solve. By employing fractional programming, we develop an alternating optimization framework to solve the problem via a combination of Lagrange multipliers, penalty method, and gradient descent. Numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-aided hybrid beamforming scheme significantly improves the sum rate compared to its fixed-position antenna (FPA) counterpart. Moreover, with sufficiently large movable regions, the proposed scheme with sub-connected MA arrays even outperforms the fully-connected FPA array."}

The height function is a fundamental and important tool in number theory to capture the ``number-theoretic complexity\" of a point. Asymptotic formulas for the number of points in projective space below a given height have been studied by Schanuel, for example, and their coefficients can be written by class numbers, regulators, special values of the Dedekind zeta function, and other number theoretically interesting values. We consider an analogous problem for dynamical canonical height, a dynamical analogue of the height function in number theory, introduced by Call-Silverman . The main tool of this study is the dynamical height zeta function studied by Hsia. In this paper, we give explicit formulas for the dynamical height zeta function in special cases, derive general formulas for obtaining asymptotic behavior from certain functions, and combine them to derive asymptotic behavior for the number of points with bounded dynamical canonical height."}

Alamin, Bryan S. Hernandez", "subjects": "Dynamical Systems (math.DS)", "abstract": "Power law systems have been studied extensively due to their wide-ranging applications, particularly in chemistry. In this work, we focus on an important subclass of power law systems, which generalizes the mass action framework where every pair of reactions sharing identical reactant complexes possesses identical kinetic order vectors, that can be decomposed into stoichiometrically independent subsystems. We show that for such systems, if the deficiencies of the underlying individual subnetworks sum up to the deficiency of the entire network, and the ranks of the augmented matrices containing the kinetic order vectors of the subnetworks sum up to the rank of the augmented matrix containing the kinetic order vectors of the entire network, then the existence of the positive steady states of each stoichiometrically-independent subsystem is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the positive steady states of the given power law system. We illustrate this result by providing illustrative examples, one of which is a network of a carbon cycle model that satisfies the assumptions, while the other network fails to meet the assumptions. Finally, using the aforementioned result, we present a systematic method for deriving positive steady state parametrizations for the mentioned subclass of power law systems with identical stoichiometrically independent subnetworks, which is a generalization of our recent method for mass action systems."}

Secondly, we establish asymptotic stability of the stratified density, which is strictly decreasing in the vertical direction, under sufficiently regular perturbations, proving that the solution converges to the unique minimizer of the total energy. Our analysis is based on the energy method. Although the total energy dissipates due to kinematic viscosity, such mechanism cannot capture the stratification of the density.

Accordingly, the most well-adopted choice of the coupling function is the sine function. Due to the oddness of the sine function, the synchronized frequency would be the average of all the natural frequencies. In this article, we study the synchronization behaviors of the Kuramoto model with a pure competition coupling function. Namely, instead of the sine function, we choose $\\max \\{0, \\sin \\theta \\}$ to be the coupling function. This indicates the relation of pure competition between oscillators. We prove asymptotical phase synchronization for identical oscillators and asymptotical frequency synchronization for non-identical oscillators under reasonable sufficient conditions. In particular, under our sufficient conditions, the synchronized frequency is the maximal frequency of all the natural frequencies. On the other hand, in the parameter regime which is out of the scope of the analysis of our theorems, it is possible that the synchronized frequency could be larger than the maximal frequency of the natural frequencies of all the oscillators. In this article, we also provide numerical experiments to support the analysis of our theorem and to demonstrate the aforementioned phenomenon."}

The primary issue is identifying auxiliary tasks that closely resemble the original expensive task. We suggested a sampling strategy based on job importance, creating a compact matrix by extracting crucial rows from the entire problem specification matrix of the expensive task. This matrix serves as an economical auxiliary task. Mathematically, we proved that this economical auxiliary task bears similarity to its corresponding expensive task. The subsequent concern revolves around making auxiliary tasks more cost-effective. We determined the sampling proportions for the entire problem specification matrix through factorial design experiments, resulting in a more compact auxiliary task. With a reduced search space and shorter function evaluation time, it can rapidly furnish high-quality transferable information for the primary task. The last aspect involves designing transferable deep information from auxiliary tasks. We regarded the job priorities in the (sub-) optimal solutions to the economical auxiliary task as transferable invariants. By adopting a partial solution patching strategy, we augmented specificity knowledge onto the common knowledge to adapt to the target expensive task. The strategies devised for constructing task pairs and facilitating knowledge transfer, when incorporated into various evolutionary multitasking algorithms, were utilized to address expensive instances of permutation flow shop scheduling. Extensive experiments and statistical comparisons have validated that, with the collaborative synergy of these strategies, the performance of evolutionary multitasking algorithms is significantly enhanced in handling expensive scheduling tasks."}

By taking into account that there exists a one-to one correspondence between Poisson--Lie groups and Lie bialgebra structures, a number of deformed Poisson coalgebras can be obtained, which allow the construction of integrable deformations of coupled Rikitake systems. Moreover, the integrals of the motion for coupled systems can be explicitly obtained by means of the deformed coproduct map. The same procedure can be also applied when the initial system is bi-Hamiltonian with respect to two different Lie-Poisson algebras. In this case, to preserve a bi-Hamiltonian structure under deformation, a common Lie bialgebra structure for the two Lie-Poisson structures has to be found. Coupled dynamical systems arising from this bi-Hamiltonian deformation scheme are also presented, and the use of collective `cluster variables', turns out to be enlightening in order to analyse their dynamical behaviour. As a general feature, the approach here presented provides a novel connection between Lie bialgebras and integrable dynamical systems."}

It has been shown that randomized codes can be strictly better under a number of formulations. In particular, the role of common randomness has been well studied. We elucidate the role of private randomness in the compression of a memoryless source $X^n=(X_1,...,X_n)$ under two kinds of realism constraints. The near-perfect realism constraint requires the joint distribution of output symbols $(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ to be arbitrarily close the distribution of the source in total variation distance (TVD). The per-symbol near-perfect realism constraint requires that the TVD between the distribution of output symbol $Y_t$ and the source distribution be arbitrarily small, uniformly in the index $t.$ We characterize the corresponding asymptotic rate-distortion trade-off and show that encoder private randomness is not useful if the compression rate is lower than the entropy of the source, however limited the resources in terms of common randomness and decoder private randomness may be."}

We demonstrate that with an appropriate proportion of generalized constraint (GC) nodes, GLDPC codes can reduce the original gap to capacity compared to their original LDPC counterparts over the BEC and BI-AWGN channels. Additionally, on the BI-AWGN channel, we adopt Gaussian mixture distributions to approximate the message distributions from variable nodes and Gaussian distributions for those from constraint nodes. This approximation technique significantly enhances the precision of the channel parameter threshold compared to traditional Gaussian approximations while maintaining a low computational complexity similar to that of Gaussian approximations. Our simulation experiments provide empirical evidence that GLDPC codes, when decoded with the APP decoder and equipped with the right fraction of GC nodes, can achieve substantial performance improvements compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes."}

However, positioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best combination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam interference, this paper explores the utilization of flexible beam scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can adjust beam directions toward the same earth-fixed cell to send positioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formulated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we first prove the monotonic relationship between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem, and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Simulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy is improved by $17.1\\%$ and $55.9\\%$ when the beam transmission power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively."}

This ultimately results in the failure of optimization that is based on gradient descent in the training process. Relaxation systems provide a smooth asymptotic to the discontinuity solution, under the expectation that macroscopic problems can be solved from a microscopic perspective. Based on relaxation systems, the RelaxNN framework alleviates the conflict of losses in the training process of the PINN framework.

This paper proposes a new approximation method for multiple joint chance constraints (JCCs) to model the uncertainty in dispatch problems, which solves the conservativeness and potential infeasibility concerns of CVaR. The proposed method is also convenient for controlling the risk levels of different JCCs, which is necessary for power system applications since different resources may be affected by varying degrees of uncertainty or have different importance to the system. We then formulate a data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained programming model for the power system multiperiod dispatch problem and leverage the proposed approximation method to solve it. In the numerical simulations, two small general examples clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, and the results of the multiperiod dispatch problem on IEEE test cases verify its practicality."}

For 500 cities in the United States, we explored how many additional supermarkets would be required to achieve various levels of $x$-minute access and where new stores should be located so that this access is equally-distributed. Our method is unique because it combines a novel measure of equality with a new model that optimally locates amenities for inequality-minimizing community access. We found that 25% of the studied cities could reach 15-minute access by adding five or fewer stores, while only 10% of the cities could even achieve 5-minute average access when using neighborhood centroids as potential sites; the cities that could, on average, required more than 100 stores each. This work provides a tool for cities to use evidenced-based planning to efficiently retrofit in order to enable active transport, benefiting both the climate and their residents' health. It also highlights the major challenge facing our cities due to the existing and ongoing car-dependent urban design that renders these goals unfeasible."}

A key advance is a $p$-robust parameter selection. The analysis of the new method with a different fine-tuned volume stabilization allows for a priori quasi-best approximation and improved $L^2$ error estimates as well as a stabilization-free reliable and efficient a posteriori error control. The associated adaptive mesh-refining algorithm performs superior in computer benchmarks with striking numerical evidence for optimal higher empirical convergence rates."}

In this paper, we propose a non-work-conserving F/P (freeze/preempt) policy for which the sampling and transmission process is frozen for an Erlang distributed amount of time upon each transmission, and out-of-order packets are preempted immediately at the source, rather than being discarded at the monitor upon reception. We use the absorbing Markov chain (AMC) method to obtain the exact distributions of AoI and also the peak AoI (PAoI) processes, for both ZW and F/P policies.

For example, a negative regularization level can be optimal under covariate shift or regression shift, even when the training features are isotropic or the design is underparameterized. Furthermore, we prove that the optimally-tuned risk is monotonic in the data aspect ratio, even in the out-of-distribution setting and when optimizing over negative regularization levels. In general, our results do not make any modeling assumptions for the train or the test distributions, except for moment bounds, and allow for arbitrary shifts and the widest possible range of (negative) regularization levels."}

In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments."}

The MEP problem can be used to jointly plan various grid assets, such as transmission, generation, and battery storage capacities; examples include identifying grid investments that minimize emissions in the absence of a carbon tax, maximizing the profit of a portfolio of renewable investments and long-term energy contracts, or reducing price inequities between different grid stakeholders. The MEP problem, however, is in general nonconvex, making it difficult to solve exactly for large real-world systems. Therefore, we propose a fast stochastic implicit gradient-based heuristic method that scales well to large networks with many scenarios. We use a strong duality reformulation and the McCormick envelope to provide a lower bound on the performance of our algorithm via convex relaxation. We test the performance of our method on a large model of the U.S. Western Interconnect and demonstrate that it scales linearly with network size and number of scenarios and can be efficiently parallelized on large machines. We find that for medium-sized 16 hour cases, gradient descent on average finds a 5.3x lower objective value in 16.5x less time compared to a traditional reformulation-based approach solved with an interior point method. We conclude with a large example in which we jointly plan transmission, generation, and storage for a 768 hour case on 100 node system, showing that emissions penalization leads to additional 40.0% reduction in carbon intensity at an additional cost of $17.1/MWh."}

Hanson", "subjects": "Logic (math.LO)", "abstract": "We construct a topos in which the Dedekind reals are countable. To accomplish this, we first define a new kind of toposes that we call parameterized realizability toposes. They are built from partial combinatory algebras whose application operation depends on a parameter, and in which realizers operate uniformly with respect to a given parameter set. Our topos is the parameterized realizability topos whose realizers are oracle-computable partial maps, with oracles serving as parameters and ranging over the representations of a non-diagonalizable sequence, discovered by Joseph Miller. It is a sequence of reals in $[0,1]$ that is non-diagonalizable in the sense that any real in $[0,1]$ that is oracle-computable, uniformly in oracles representing the sequence, must already appear in the sequence. The Dedekind reals are countable in the topos because the non-diagonalizable sequence appears in it as an epimorphism. The topos is intuitionistic, as it invalidates both the law of excluded middle and the axiom of countable choice. The Cauchy reals are uncountable. The Hilbert cube is countable, from which Brouwer's fixed-point theorem follows as an easy corollary of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem. From the 1-dimensional Brouwer's fixed-point theorem we obtain the intermediate value theorem and the lesser limited principle of omniscience. The Kreisel-Lacombe-Shoenfield-Tseitin theorem stating that all real-valued maps are continuous is valid, because the usual proof is uniform with respect to oracles. Lastly, the closed interval $[0,1]$, being countable, can trivially be covered by a sequence of open intervals whose lengths add up to any prescribed $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, and such a cover has no finite subcover. However, we show that any sequence of open intervals with rational endpoints covering $[0,1]$ must has a finite subcover."}

Arriving EVs receive feedback on transport times to each station, and waiting times at congested ones, based on which they make a selfish selection. This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner's allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory. An extension of the model that makes customer demand elastic to observed delays is also presented, and analyzed with extensions of the optimization machinery. Simulations to illustrate the global behavior are presented, which also help validate the model beyond the fluid approximation."}

Specifically, we focus on problems where the objective function is strongly convex with Lipschitz continuous gradient and Hessian. Our results hold for any initial point and any symmetric positive definite initial Hessian approximation matrix. The analysis unveils a detailed three-phase convergence process, characterized by distinct linear and superlinear rates, contingent on the iteration progress. Additionally, our theoretical findings demonstrate the trade-offs between linear and superlinear convergence rates for BFGS when we modify the initial Hessian approximation matrix, a phenomenon further corroborated by our numerical experiments."}
