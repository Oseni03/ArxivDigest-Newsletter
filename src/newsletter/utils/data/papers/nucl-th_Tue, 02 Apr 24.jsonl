Papenbrock", "subjects": "Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)", "abstract": "Atomic nuclei exhibit multiple energy scales ranging from hundreds of MeV in binding energies to fractions of an MeV for low-lying collective excitations. As the limits of nuclear binding is approached near the neutron- and proton driplines, traditional shell-structure starts to melt with an onset of deformation and an emergence of coexisting shapes. It is a long-standing challenge to describe this multiscale physics starting from nuclear forces with roots in quantum chromodynamics. Here we achieve this within a unified and non-perturbative framework that captures both short- and long-range correlations starting from modern nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. The short-range correlations which accounts for the bulk of the binding energy is included within a symmetry-breaking framework, while long-range correlations (and fine details about the collective structure) are included via symmetry projection. Our calculations accurately reproduce available experimental data for low-lying collective states and the electromagnetic quadrupole transitions in $^{20-30}$Ne. We also reveal coexisting spherical and deformed shapes in $^{30}$Ne, which indicates the breakdown of the magic neutron number $N=20$ as the key nucleus $^{28}$O is approached, and we predict that the dripline nuclei $^{32,34}$Ne are strongly deformed. By developing reduced-order-models for symmetry-projected states, we perform a global sensitivity analysis and find that the subleading singlet S-wave contact and a pion-nucleon coupling strongly impact nuclear deformation in chiral effective-field-theory. The techniques developed in this work clarify how microscopic nuclear forces generate the multiscale physics of nuclei spanning collective phenomena as well as short-range correlations and allow to capture emergent and dynamical phenomena in finite fermion systems."}

In particular, we study the low-lying states of 6Li and 12C using the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model. For a narrow standard deviation of approximately 1% on the low-energy constants which parametrize high-precision chiral potentials, we find output standard deviations in the collective observables ranging from approximately 3-6%. The results mark the first step towards a rigorous uncertainty quantification of collectivity in nuclei that aims to account for all sources of uncertainty in ab initio descriptions of challenging collective and clustering observables."}

Lopes", "subjects": "Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)", "abstract": "In December 2023, the Fermi LAT Catalog announced the discovery of 33 new millisecond pulsars. Motivated by that, in this work, I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope $(L)$ affect the properties of static and slowly rotating neutron stars. For fixed values of angular velocity, I study how the slope influences the increase of the maximum mass, the radii of the canonical 1.4 solar mass, its eccentricity, as well the same quantities for the 2.01 $M_\\odot$ stars. I show that different slope values cause different variations not only the absolute quantities but also in relative ones. Indeed, different slope values predict different values for the eccentricity, which does not depend on the absolute value of the neutron stars' radii. Therefore, this quantity can be a powerful tool to constrain the symmetry energy slope."}

Saxena, Dashty T. Akrawy, Ali H. Ahmed, Mamta Aggarwal", "subjects": "Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)", "abstract": "Various decay modes in superheavy nuclei have been of significant interest among which cluster radioactivity has recently gained sizable attention. The {\\alpha}-decay being a predominant decay mode in the superheavy region, the accurate determination of cluster decay half-lives is also crucial in this region as it has tremendous potential to be explored as one of the major decay channels. The usability of the Royer analytical formula [Nuclear Physics A 683 (2001) 182], which is based on the asymmetric fission model, has been investigated for the cluster and {\\alpha} decay in superheavy region, by comparing it with several other (semi)empirical/analytical formulas. After fitting the formula on around 100 cluster-decay data and around 423 {\\alpha}-decay data, the refitted Royer formula (RRF) is found to be very robust which is able to estimate the cluster decay and {\\alpha}-decay half-lives with good accuracy. In fact, a comparison of the half-lives of both the decay modes using the same formula points towards a substantial chance of heavy cluster (Kr and Sr) decay from various isotopes of Z=118 and 120. Hence, the formula proposed in this study works fairly well for the estimation of cluster decay half-lives in superheavy regions where most empirical formulas fail to match with the half-lives from the various established theories."}

Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic bases with hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which controls the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of pairs of anti-charm/charm quarks through the rotation of Feynman diagrams using cross symmetry for elastic scattering of charm quark with thermal partons ((anti-)quarks or gluons) in the sQGP by the exchange of the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Comparing with the experimental data on the $R_{\\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass."}

The scaled variance of particle number distribution inside different coordinate and momentum space acceptances is computed through ensemble averaging and found to agree with earlier results obtained using time averaging, validating the ergodic hypothesis for fluctuation observables. Presence of a sizable collective flow is found to be essential for observing large fluctuations from the critical point in momentum space acceptances. We discuss our findings in the context of heavy-ion collisions."}

I have successfully analyzed the experimental angular distributions in $\\alpha$+$\\alpha$ scattering systematically over a wide range of incident energies $E_L$=53.4 - 280 MeV using a phenomenological optical model with a deep real potential. The existence of a farside-dominant quasinuclear rainbow with no well-defined rainbow angle and no supernumerary bow in the lit side followed by the shadow, which is not a genuine rainbow but a refractive scattering from a marginally small droplet at high energies, is found for the first time in $\\alpha$+$\\alpha$ scattering. The refraction due to the deep potentials with an attractive core at short distances are discussed from the viewpoint of the Luneburg. The deep vs shallow problem of the potential and the nuclear rainbow scattering in inelastic channels are also discussed."}
