In particular, we prove that: a finite group $G$ is supersoluble if and only if $G$ has a normal subgroup $D$ such that $G/D$ is supersoluble and $D$ avoids every chief factor of $G$ between $V^{G}$ and $V_{G}$ for every maximal subgroup $V$ of the generalized Fitting subgroup $F^{*}(G)$ of $G$; a finite soluble group $G$ is a $PST$-group (that is, Sylow permutability is a transitive relation on $G$) if and only if $G$ has a normal subgroup $D$ such that $G/D$ is nilpotent and $D$ avoids every chief factor of $G$ between $V^{G}$ and $V_{G}$ for every subnormal subgroup $A$ of $G$."}

Fernandez-Alcober, Matteo Pintonello", "subjects": "Group Theory (math.GR)", "abstract": "Let $w=w(x_1,\\ldots,x_r)$ be an outer commutator word. We show that the word $w(u_1,\\ldots,u_r)$ is concise whenever $u_1,\\ldots,u_r$ are non-commutator words in disjoint sets of variables. This applies in particular to words of the form $w(x_1^{n_1},\\ldots,x_r^{n_r})$, where the $n_i$ are non-zero integers. Our approach is via the study of values of $w$ on normal subgroups, and in this setting we obtain the following result: if $N_1,\\ldots,N_r$ are normal subgroups of a group $G$ and the set of all values $w(g_1,\\ldots,g_r)$ with $g_i\\in N_i$ is finite then also the subgroup generated by these values, i.e. $w(N_1,\\ldots,N_r)$, is finite."}

More precisely, if $G$ is a countable group and $H$ is an infinite subgroup of $G$ such that the pair $(G,H)$ has relative Property $\\mathrm{(TTT)}$, then the weak Haagerup constant $\\boldsymbol\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{WH}}(G)$ is strictly greater than $1$. We apply this result to some semidirect products and lattices in higher rank algebraic groups."}

Following Snopce-Tanushevski, a pro-$p$ group $G$ is called Frattini-resistant if the function $H\\mapsto\\Phi(H)$, from the poset of all closed finitely-generated subgroups of $G$ into itself, is a poset embedding. We prove that for an oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ group (oriented pro-$p$ RAAG) $G$ associated to an oriented graph the following four conditions are equivalent: the associated oriented graph is of elementary type; $G$ is Frattini-resistant; every topologically finitely generated closed subgroup of $G$ is an oriented pro-$p$ RAAG; $G$ is the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field containing a root of 1 of order $p$. Also, we conjecture that in the $\\mathbb{Z}/p$-cohomology of a Frattini-resistant pro-$p$ group there are no essential triple Massey products."}

Moreover, it is shown that the group $H$ can be constructed to have decidable Word problem if and only if the Word problem of $R$ is decidable, yielding a refinement of a theorem of Clapham. Finally, it is proved that for any countable group $G$ and any computable function $\\ell:G\\to\\mathbb{N}$ satisfying some necessary requirements, there exists a malnormal embedding enjoying the Congruence Extension Property of $G$ into a finitely presented group $H$ such that the restriction of $|\\cdot|_H$ to $G$ is equivalent to $\\ell$, producing a refinement of a result of Ol'shanskii."}
