Most prior studies have utilized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to handle the discrete nature of molecular representations in GANs. However, due to the inherent instability in training GANs and RL models, along with the high computational cost associated with MCTS sampling, MCTS RL-based GANs struggle to scale to large chemical databases. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel GAN based on actor-critic RL with instant and global rewards, called InstGAN, to generate molecules at the token-level with multi-property optimization. Furthermore, maximized information entropy is leveraged to alleviate the mode collapse. The experimental results demonstrate that InstGAN outperforms other baselines, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, and efficiently generates molecules with multi-property optimization. The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper."}

This study investigated the microbial communities and potential health risks associated with the UNESCO-classified Norwegian Sea Trade Archive (NSTA) collection exhibiting visible microbial colonization and staff health concerns. Dust samples from book surfaces and the storage environment were analysed using culturing methods, qPCR, Next Generation Sequencing, and mycotoxin, cytotoxicity and azole resistance assays. Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., and Cladosporium sp. were the most common fungi identified, with some potentially toxic species like Stachybotrys sp., Toxicladosporium sp. and Aspergillus section Fumigati. Fungal resistance to azoles was not detected. Only one mycotoxin, sterigmatocystin, was found in a heavily contaminated book. Dust extracts from books exhibited moderate to high cytotoxicity on human lung cells, suggesting a potential respiratory risk. The collection had higher contamination levels compared to the storage environment, likely due to improved storage conditions. Even though, overall low contamination levels were obtained, which might be underestimated due to the presence of salt (from cod preservation) that could have interfered with the analyses. This study underlines the importance of monitoring microbial communities and implementing proper storage measures to safeguard cultural heritage and staff well-being."}

Thomas", "subjects": "Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)", "abstract": "Although the raison d'etre of the brain is the survival of the body, there are relatively few theoretical studies of closed-loop rhythmic motor control systems. In this paper we provide a unified framework, based on variational analysis, for investigating the dual goals of performance and robustness in powerstroke-recovery systems. We augment two previously published closed-loop motor control models by equipping each model with a performance measure based on the rate of progress of the system relative to a spatially extended external substrate -- such as progress relative to the ground for a locomotor task. The sensitivity measure quantifies the ability of the system to maintain performance in response to external perturbations. Motivated by a search for optimal design principles for feedback control achieving the complementary requirements of efficiency and robustness, we discuss the performance-sensitivity patterns of the systems featuring different sensory feedback architectures. In a paradigmatic half-center oscillator (HCO)-motor system, we observe that the excitation-inhibition property of feedback mechanisms determines the sensitivity pattern while the activation-inactivation property determines the performance pattern. Moreover, we show that the nonlinearity of the sigmoid activation of feedback signals allows the existence of optimal combinations of performance and sensitivity. In a detailed hindlimb locomotor system, we find that a force-dependent feedback can simultaneously optimize both performance and robustness, while length-dependent feedback variations result in significant performance-versus-sensitivity tradeoffs. Thus, this work provides an analytical framework for studying feedback control of oscillations in nonlinear dynamical systems, leading to several insights that have the potential to inform the design of control or rehabilitation systems."}

This model describes the influence of vaccination decision on epidemic progression in different age groups. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution using the fixed point theory. In a particular case of age-independent model, we determine the final size of epidemic, that is, the limiting number of susceptible individuals at asymptotically large time. Numerical simulations show that the information-based vaccine acceptance can significantly influence the epidemic progression. Though the initial stage of epidemic progression is the same for all memory kernels, as the epidemic progresses and more information about the disease becomes available, further epidemic progression strongly depends on the memory effect. Short-range memory kernel appears to be more effective in restraining the epidemic outbreaks because it allows for more responsive and adaptive vaccination decisions based on the most recent information about the disease."}

Perez-Reche", "subjects": "Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Probability (math.PR)", "abstract": "The process of infection of a host is complex, influenced by factors such as microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose across hosts. This study uses dose-response and microbial growth models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a microbial growth model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging laboratory experiments that could deepen our understanding of infections."}

Such simple observation with attention mechanism has a profound implication on our understanding of how the brain works. The nonlinear effects generated by inhibitory networks have long been known to provide a ``winner-take-all'' mechanism for localized attention. This attention mechanism, at the system level, implements the selection/positioning operation needed by the hippocampus to provide spatio-temporal context to the neocortex. The localized receptive field of sensory organs, when inspected under the framework of embodied cognition, turns from a constraint to an advantage. Since we only need access to a local map, positioning works better than reconstruction. Such simple intuition implies that the attention mechanism is all you need to understand the flexible behavior generated by hippocampal-neocortical systems. Geometrically, we present a novel manifold positioning framework to explain the principle of localized embodied cognition. Through the co-evolution of the hippocampus and the neocortex, the positioning operation implemented by the attention mechanism can be interpreted as a nonlinear projection linking the discovery of local subspace structure by the neocortex (a sensorimotor machine generating the world map) with the navigation task in mind and $without$ discovering global manifold topology by the hippocampus (the neocortex's map index)."}

The EEG encoding method is very simple, and forms a baseline from which more sophisticated EEG encoding methods can be compared. We have also evaluated the fidelity of the generated image using the same metrics used in the previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) works. Our results show that while the reconstruction from EEG recorded to rapidly presented images is not as good as reconstructions from fMRI to slower presented images, it holds a surprising amount of information that could be applied in specific use cases. Also, EEG-based image reconstruction works better in some categories-such as land animals and food-than others, shedding new light on previous findings of EEG's sensitivity to those categories and revealing potential for these methods to further understand EEG responses to human visual coding. More investigation should use longer-duration image stimulations to elucidate the later components that might be salient to the different image categories."}
