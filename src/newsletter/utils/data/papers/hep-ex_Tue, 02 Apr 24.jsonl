The accurate simulation of these interactions at low energies ($<$100 MeV) is crucial for the detection and study of supernova, solar and atmospheric neutrinos. In particular, the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino properties depends on the ability to measure the products from the deexcitation of the final state nucleus after the initial neutrino-nucleus scattering reaction. A realistic nuclear deexcitation model that can correctly manage the theoretical uncertainties in the process is key to determine the response of a detector to low energy neutrinos and estimate the overall systematic uncertainties that affect it. Automatic differentiation frameworks like PyTorch or JAX, widely used in the field of Machine Learning, provide us the tools to compute exact gradients of the simulation outputs with respect to the model parameters. Such differentiable simulators can be applied in simulator tuning to match observed data and forward modeling to efficiently infer the impact of parameter distributions to the physics output, or for parameter inference acting as a likelihood estimator. This paradigm can pave the way to a fully differentiable analysis of the whole simulation chain or direct integration with preexisting Machine Learning tools. As a proof of concept, in this work we implement a fully differentiable nuclear deexcitation simulation based on a simplified version of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical emission model."}

We report the results of a pathfinder dark photon dark matter cavity search experiment performed at Hunan Normal University and the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, representing the first stage of the APEX (Axion and dark Photon EXperiment) program. Finding no statistically significant excess, we place an upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter $|\\chi|<3.7\\times 10^{-13}$ around $m_A\\simeq 29.5$ $\\mu$eV at 90% confidence level.

This review provides a detailed examination of current and past ML techniques in this domain. It starts by exploring various data representation methods and ML architectures, encompassing traditional ML algorithms and advanced deep learning techniques. Subsequent sections discuss specific instances of successful ML applications in jet flavor tagging in the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, ranging from basic fully-connected layers to graph neural networks employing attention mechanisms. To systematically categorize the advancements over the LHC's three runs, the paper classifies jet tagging algorithms into three generations, each characterized by specific data representation techniques and ML architectures. This classification aims to provide an overview of the chronological evolution in this field. Finally, a brief discussion about anticipated future developments and potential research directions in the field is presented."}
