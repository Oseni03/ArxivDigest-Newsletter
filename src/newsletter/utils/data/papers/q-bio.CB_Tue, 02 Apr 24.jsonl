During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two different phenotypes: M1, which can worsen brain injury; or M2, which can aid in long-term recovery. In this study, we contribute a summary of experimental data on microglial cell counts in the penumbra following ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and compile available data sets into a single set suitable for time series analysis. Further, we formulate a mathematical model of microglial cells in the penumbra during ischemic stroke due to MCAO. Through use of global sensitivity analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based parameter estimation, we analyze the effects of the model parameters on the number of M1 and M2 cells in the penumbra and fit identifiable parameters to the compiled experimental data set. We utilize results from MCMC parameter estimation to ascertain uncertainty bounds and forward predictions for the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells over time. Results demonstrate the significance of parameters related to M1 and M2 activation on the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells. Simulations further suggest that potential outliers in the observed data may be omitted and forecast predictions suggest a lingering inflammatory response."}
