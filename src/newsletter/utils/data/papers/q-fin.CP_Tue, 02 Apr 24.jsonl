In this paper, we systematically compare many possible variants of the originally proposed method on S\\&P 500 stocks. We use daily data from twenty-seven years as training set and their following year as test set. We thus select the best network-based methods according to different viewpoints including for instance the highest Sharpe Ratio and the highest expected return. We give emphasis in new centrality measures and we also conduct a thorough analysis, which reveals significantly stronger results compared to those with more traditional methods. According to our analysis, this graph-theoretical approach to investment can be used successfully by investors with different investment profiles leading to high risk-adjusted returns."}
