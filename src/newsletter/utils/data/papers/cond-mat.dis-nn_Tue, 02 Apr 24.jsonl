R\u00f6mer", "subjects": "Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)", "abstract": "The real-space renormalisation group method can be applied to the Chalker-Coddington model of the quantum Hall transition to provide a convenient numerical estimation of the localisation critical exponent, $\\nu$. Previous such studies found $\\nu\\sim 2.39$ which falls considerably short of the current best estimates by transfer matrix ($\\nu\\approx 2.593$) and exact-diagonalisation studies ($\\nu=2.58(3)$). By increasing the amount of data $500$ fold we can now measure closer to the critical point and find an improved estimate $\\nu\\approx 2.51$. This deviates only $\\sim 3\\%$ from the previous two values and is already better than the $\\sim 7\\%$ accuracy of the classical small-cell renormalisation approach from which our method is adapted. We also study a previously proposed mixing of the Chalker-Coddington model with a classical scattering model which is meant to provide a route to understanding why experimental estimates give a lower $\\nu\\sim 2.3$. Upon implementing this mixing into our RG unit, we find only further increases to the value of $\\nu$."}
