Engineering MC to control the reaction systems in cells is expected for many applications such as targeted drug delivery and biocomputing. Toward control of the reaction systems as desired via MC, it is important to transmit signals without distortion by MC since the reaction systems are often triggered depending on the concentration of signaling molecules arriving at the cells. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze signal distortion caused by diffusion-based MC channels using frequency response of channels. The proposed method provides indices that quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of distortion and shows parameter conditions of MC channels that suppress signal distortion. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate the design procedure of specific MC channels that satisfy given specifications. Finally, the roles of MC channels in nature are discussed from the perspective of signal distortion."}
