{"main_page": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01279", "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01279", "title": "Lower bounds and integrality gaps in simplicial decomposition", "authors": "Matthew Ellison", "subjects": "Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Combinatorics (math.CO)", "abstract": "Let $\\mathcal{K}$ be a finite pure simplicial $d$-complex, with oriented facets $\\{F_i\\}$, which is boundaryless in the sense that $\\sum\\partial F_i=0$. We call such a $\\mathcal{K}$ an \\textit{admissible $d$-complex}. Given an admissible $d$-complex, one can ask for the smallest collection $\\{T_i\\}$ of oriented $(d+1)$-simplices on the vertices of $\\mathcal{K}$ which decomposes $\\mathcal{K}$ in the sense that $\\sum \\partial T_i = \\mathcal{K}$. Let the minimum size of such a collection be $V_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathcal{K})$, and let $V_\\mathbb{Q}(\\mathcal{K})$ be the relaxed analog where fractional $(d+1)$-simplices may be used. We explain how these quantities may be computed via integer and linear programming, and show how lower bounds may be obtained by exploiting LP-duality. We then prove that $V_\\mathbb{Q}$ and $V_\\mathbb{Z}$ are both additive under disjoint union and connected sum along a $d$-simplex. The remainder of the paper explores integrality gaps between $V_\\mathbb{Z}$ and $V_\\mathbb{Q}$ in dimension 1, where we share what we believe is the simplest admissible complex with an integrality gap; and in dimension 2, where we collect some results on integrality gaps for triangulations of the 2-sphere for a companion paper with Zili Wang and Peter Doyle."}
