For this purpose, we use a generalized construction of the countably branching diamond graphs. As a consequence, we deduce that to be Lipschitz-universal for countable complete metric spaces, a separable complete metric space cannot be purely 1-unrectifiable. Another corollary is the existence of an uncountable family of pairwise non-isomorphic Lipschitz-free spaces over purely 1-unrectifiable metric spaces. Some results on compact reduction are also obtained."}

In the present paper we examine the Arens regularity properties of closed ideals of algebras in the Wesebai class. We observe that, although Wesebai algebras are always strongly Arens irregular, a variety of Arens regularity properties can be observed within their closed ideals. After characterizing Arens regular ideals and strongly Arens irregular ideals, we proceed to particularize to the main examples of Wesebai algebras, the convolution group algebras $L^1(G)$, $G$ compact, and the Fourier algebras $A(\\Gamma)$, $\\Gamma$ discrete and amenable. We find examples of Arens regular ideals in $L^1(G)$ and $A(\\Gamma)$, both reflexive and nonreflexive and examples of strongly Arens irregular ideals that are not in the Wesebai class. In finding these examples, we prove that every infinite Abelian group contains a Rosenthal set that is not $\\Lambda(p)$, for any $p>0$, a result that could be of independent interest."}

Concretely, we select four different elements in the hyperinterpolation-class, namely filtered hyperinterpolation, Lasso hyperinterpolation, hard thresholding hyperinterpolation and generalized hyperinterpolation introduced by Dai [10], to explore their algebraic properties on the sphere. Based on the idea of a discrete (semi) inner product, we propose the concepts of hyper self-adjoint operator, hyper projection operator and hyper algebra. Next, we prove generalized hyperinterpolation is hyper self-adjoint and commutative with hyperinterpolation. Then we establish corresponding results of the product, sum and difference of hyper projection operators. Last but not least, we present the results of ideals between hard thresholding hyperinterpolation and hyperinterpolation. We also give a preliminary result of involutions, and also introduce the concepts of hyper $C^{\\ast}$-algebra and hyper homomorphism."}

Baskakov, Ilya A. Krishtal, Natalia B. Uskova", "subjects": "Functional Analysis (math.FA); Spectral Theory (math.SP)", "abstract": "We consider similarity transformations of a perturbed linear operator $A-B$ in a complex Banach space $\\mathcal{X}$, where the unperturbed operator $A$ is a generator of a Banach $L_1(\\mathbb{R})$-module and the perturbation operator $B$ is a bounded linear operator. The result of the transformation is a simpler operator $A-B_0$. For example, if $A$ is a differentiation operator and $B$ is an operator of multiplication by an operator-valued function, then $B_0$ is an operator of multiplication by a function that is a restriction of an entire function of exponential type and could be $0$ in some cases. As a consequence, we derive the spectral invariance of the operator $A-B$ in a large class of spaces. The study is based on a widely applicable modification of the method of similar operators that is also presented in the paper. This non-traditional modification is rooted in the spectral theory of Banach $L_1(\\mathbb{R})$-modules."}

This requires an in-depth understanding of the order structure on the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$, which we provide. These properties of $X_{-1}$ also enable us to discuss when zero-class admissibility is automatic. While those limit-cases are the weakest form of admissibility on the $L^p$-scale, it is remarkable that they sometimes follow from order theoretic and geometric assumptions. Our assumptions on the geometries of the involved spaces are minimal."}
