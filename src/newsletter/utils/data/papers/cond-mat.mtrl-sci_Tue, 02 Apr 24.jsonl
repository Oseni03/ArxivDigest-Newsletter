We demonstrate two novel approaches to characterize local environments in different polymorphs of molecular crystals using learning models that employ either flexibly learned or handcrafted molecular representations. In the first case, we follow our earlier work on graph learning in molecular crystals, deploying an atomistic graph convolutional network, combined with molecule-wise aggregation, to enable per-molecule environmental classification. For the second model, we develop a new set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector representation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as well as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high classification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal polymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory data for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are applicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an essential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena."}

Gradient bandgap is a promising approach to relieve these issues, however, has not been effectively realized in Kesterite solar cells due to the challenges in controlling the gradient distribution of alloying elements at high temperatures. Herein, targeting at the Cd alloyed CZTS, we propose a pre-crystallization strategy to reduce the intense vertical mass transport and Cd rapid diffusion in the film growth process, thereby realizing front Cd-gradient CZTS absorber. The Cd-gradient CZTS absorber, exhibiting downward bending conduction band structure, has significantly enhanced the minority carrier transport and additionally improved band alignment and interface property of CZTS/CdS heterojunction. Ultimately, we have achieved a champion total-area efficiency of 13.5% (active-area efficiency: 14.1%) in the cell and in particular a high open-circuit voltage of >800 mV. We have also achieved a certified total-area cell efficiency of 13.16%, realizing a substantial step forward for the pure sulfide Kesterite solar cell."}

In different applications, these photoluminescent defects are often placed in a nanostructured host or close to surfaces in order to enhance the signal from the defects. However, proximity to the surface not only modifies frequencies of the quantum emission from the defect, but also adversely affects their photo-stability, resulting in blinking and/or photobleaching of the defect. These effects can be ameliorated by passivating surfaces with optimal adsorbates. In this work, we explore different passivation schemes using density functional theory-based calculations. We show that a uniform surface passivation with either hydrogen or with mixed hydrogen/hydroxyl groups completely removes surface states from the SiC band gap, restoring the optical properties of the defects."}

However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters."}

However, the underlying mechanisms behind the observed giant conductance of charged domain walls remain poorly understood. Using a first-principles approach that incorporates Boltzmann transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, we determine the carrier concentration, mobility, and conductivity of domain walls with head-to-head and tail-to-tail polarization orientations. Our systematic exploration reveals that the accumulation of carriers, particularly their concentration, plays a dominant role in the domain wall conductance mechanism. However, the observed conductance differences between head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls are primarily due to differences in carrier mobility. The width of the domain wall is a key factor determining the device scale. Our calculated domain wall width is significantly smaller than previously reported values. This method, not limited to a certain ferroelectric material, can be used for the optimization and application development of various domain wall materials and devices."}

Partial DOS analyses have also revealed that both Mo atoms of the unit cells have exactly the same contributions to the metallic property observed, the largest of which, compared to the rest, emerge from the $d$ valence orbitals due to being both half-empty as well as the outermost (then containing weakest-bound electrons), giving charge carriers a higher kinetic/movement degree of freedom to conduct electricity, governed by Pauli's exclusion principle."}

Here, we exploit the exchange coupling between metallic and insulating magnets for efficient electrical manipulation of heavy metal/magnetic insulator heterostructures. By inserting a thin Co layer, we enhance the spin-orbit torque efficiency by more than 20 times, which significantly reduces the switching current density. Moreover, we demonstrate field-free current-induced magnetization switching caused by a symmetry-breaking non-collinear magnetic texture.

Here, we develop DeepRelax, an efficient deep generative model designed for rapid structural relaxation without any iterative process. DeepRelax learns the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed structures directly from their unrelaxed counterparts. The ability to perform structural relaxation in just a few hundred milliseconds per structure, combined with the scalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for large-scale virtual screening. To demonstrate the universality of DeepRelax, we benchmark it against three different databases of X-Mn-O oxides, Materials Project, and Computational 2D Materials Database with various types of materials. In these tests, DeepRelax exhibits both high accuracy and efficiency in structural relaxation, as further validated by DFT calculations. Finally, we integrate DeepRelax with an implementation of uncertainty quantification, enhancing its reliability and trustworthiness in material discovery.

Using hybrid functional calculations, we investigate the intrinsic point defects and how they limit Fermi-level positions and doping in CaO. Our results reveal calcium and oxygen vacancies to be the most common intrinsic defects, acting as compensating acceptors and donors, respectively. Oxygen interstitials are also prevailing under O-rich conditions and act as compensating donors. Due to compensation by these defects, O-poor conditions are required to dope CaO n-type, while O-rich conditions are required for p-type doping. We find that, at room temperature, intrinsic CaO can only achieve Fermi-level positions between 1.76 eV above the valence-band maximum (VBM) and 1.73 eV below the conduction-band minimum (CBM). If suitable shallow dopants can be found, the allowed range of Fermi levels would increase to between VBM+0.53 eV and CBM-0.27 eV and is set by the compensating intrinsic defects. Additionally, we study hydrogen impurities, and show that hydrogen will limit p-type doping but can also act as shallow donor when substituting oxygen ($\\mathrm{H}_\\mathrm{O}$ defects)."}

We have reproduced the experimentally observed polar-nonpolar structural phase transitions and the transition temperatures ($T_c$) of LiTaO$_3$, LiReO$_3$, and LiOsO$_3$. From the calculation, we predict that LiWO$_3$ is a polar metal, which is yet to be tested experimentally. Upon doping electrons to the insulating LiTaO$_3$, the predicted $T_c$ is quickly suppressed and approaches those of the polar metals. Thus, there is a continuous crossover between ferroelectric insulators and polar metals if we dope electrons to the polar metals. Investigating the detailed material dependence of the interatomic force constants (IFCs), we explicitly show that the suppression of $T_c$ in polar metals can be ascribed to the screening of the long-range Li-O interaction, which is caused by the presence of the itinerant electrons."}
