The model introduces an enhanced CA-based methodology for wildfire prediction, emphasizing interactions between neighboring cells and incorporating major determinants of fire spread, including wind direction, wind speed, and vegetation density, while also accounting for spotting and probabilistic transitions between states in the model to mirror real-world fire behavior."}
