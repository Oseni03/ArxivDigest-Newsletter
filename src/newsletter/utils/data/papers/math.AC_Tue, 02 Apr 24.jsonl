Let K[x_{1},x_{2}] be the polynomial ring in two variables over the field K, and let L be the generalized mixed product ideal induced by a monomial ideal I. It is shown that, if I\\subset K[x_1,x_2] and the ideals substituting the monomials in I are Veronese type ideals, then L^{k} has a linear resolution for all k\\geq 1. Furthermore, we compute some algebraic invariants of generalized mixed product ideals induced by a transversal polymatroidal ideal."}

Recently, it is shown that $\\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})$ is periodically linear in $k$ for $k>>0$. We show that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})}{k}$ exists and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})}{k}=\\displaystyle \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\alpha(I_{[k]})}{k}$. That is, all these linear functions have same slope, which is equal to $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\alpha(I_{[k]})}{k}$. In particular, for Noetherian symbolic filtration, we have $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})}{k}=\\hat{\\alpha}(I),$ the Waldschmidt constant of $I$. Also, for several classes of square-free monomial ideals, we show that $\\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})\\leq \\mathrm{reg}(R/I^{(k)})$ for all $k\\geq 1$. As a special case, for any simple graph $G$, we show that $\\mathrm{v}(J(G)^{(k)}) \\leq \\mathrm{reg}(R/J(G)^{(k)})$ for all $k \\geq 1$ and $\\mathrm{v}(J(G)^{(k)}) = \\mathrm{reg}(R/J(G)^{(k)})=\\alpha(J(G)^{(k)})-1$ for all $k\\geq 1$ if and only if $G$ is a Cohen-Macaulay very-well covered graph, where $J(G)$ denotes the cover ideal of $G$."}

It is known that $J(G)$ is Cohen--Macauly if and only if the complementary graph of $G$ is a chordal graph. In this paper, we show that $J(G)$ is Gorenstein if and only if $G$ is a complete bipartite graph. Also, when a Cohen--Macaulay vertex cover ideal $J(G)$ has a Scarf resolution is characterized. Furthermore, by using both combinatorial and topological techniques, the graded Betti number $\\beta_{i,i+j}(J(G))$, where $i$ and $j$ are the projective dimension and the regularity of $J(G)$, is computed, when $G$ is either a path or a cycle."}
