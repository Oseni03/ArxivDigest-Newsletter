It is the minimal model incorporating CP4 without leading to accidental symmetries or running into immediate conflict with experiment. Imposing CP4 on the lagrangian induces remarkably tight connections between the scalar and Yukawa sectors, including the unavoidable tree-level flavor-changing neutral couplings (FCNC). Here, we explore whether it is at all possible in the CP4 3HDM to suppressed FCNC to a level compatible with the neutral meson oscillation constraints. We express the FCNC matrices in terms of physical quark observables and quark rotation parameters, and scan the Yukawa parameter space using the quark masses and mixing parameters as input. With this procedure, we find that only two out of the eight possible CP4 Yukawa sectors are compatible with the $K$, $B$, $B_s$ and, in particular, $D$-meson oscillation constraints. The results clearly indicate a way how to construct phenomenologically viable benchmark CP4 3HDMs."}

This setup mimics the production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity (such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to thermalization."}

The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known.

To compare the charm and the top contributions, it is convenient to express the NF charming loop contribution as a non-universal (i.e., dependent on the reaction) $q^2$-dependent correction $\\Delta^{\\rm NF}C_7(q^2)$ to the Wilson coefficient $C_7$. For the $B_s\\to\\gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude, the correction is found to be positive, $\\Delta^{\\rm NF} C_7(q^2)/C_7 > 0$."}

This model contains the one-gluon exchange and confinement potentials. The latter is modeled as the sum of all two-body linear potentials. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the full four-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations, and search bound and resonant states using the complex-scaling method. We then identify $3$ bound and $62$ resonant states. The bound states are all $QQ\\bar q\\bar q$ states with the isospin and spin-parity quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$: two bound $bb\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$ states with the binding energies, 153 MeV and 4 MeV below the $BB^*$ threshold, and a shallow $cc\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$ state at $-15$ MeV from the $DD^*$ threshold. The deeper $bb\\bar q \\bar q$ bound state aligns with the lattice QCD predictions, while $cc\\bar q\\bar q$ bound state, still has a much larger binding energy than the recently observed $T^+_{cc}$ by LHCb collaboration. No bound states are identified for the $QQ\\bar Q'\\bar Q'$, $QQ\\bar s\\bar s$ and $QQ\\bar q\\bar q$ with $I=1$. Our analysis shows that the bound $QQ\\bar Q'\\bar Q'$ states are more probable with a larger mass ratio, $m_Q/m_{Q'}$. Experimental investigation for these states is desired, which will enrich our understanding of hadron spectroscopy and probe insights into the confinement mechanisms within tetraquarks."}

This study makes use of an event shape classifier to separate the $``$in-jet'' deuterons and the deuterons in the UE produced in high multiplicity proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Event shape variables such as transverse spherocity allow the categorization of hard and soft components of an event, which can be divided into two respective classes; $``$jetty'' and $``$isotropic''. The $``$jetty'' deuterons minus the contribution of the deuterons from the $``$isotropic'' event are taken as $``$in-jet'' deuterons, and the coalescence mechanism is tested. The coalescence is performed with a Wigner function formalism, augmented as an afterburner to \\textsc{pythia}8. The possible enhancement of the coalescence probability of $``$in-jet'' deuterons is investigated by calculating the coalescence parameter ($B_{2}$) in different spherocity classes in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions."}

Monceaux", "subjects": "High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)", "abstract": "This work addresses the calculation of local form factors involved in the theoretical predictions of semileptonic $B$-meson decays at low-$q^2$. We present a new approach to the method of QCD Light-Cone Sum Rule with $B-$meson Light-Cone Distribution Amplitudes. In our strategy, we bypass the quark-hadron duality (QHD) approximation which usually contributes an unknown and potentially large systematic error to the prediction of form factors. We trade this improvement for an increased reliance on higher-order contributions in perturbation theory. Unlike the systematic error from QHD, truncation errors are assessable and systematically improvable, hence allowing robust predictions of form factors. For the transitions $B\\to \\pi,\\rho,K^{(*)}$, our predictions agree with the literature for all form factors at $q^2=0$."}
