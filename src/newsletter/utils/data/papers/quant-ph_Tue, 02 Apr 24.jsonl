However, realizing non-Abelian topologically ordered states is notoriously challenging in both condensed matter and programmable quantum systems, and it was not until recently that signatures of non-Abelian statistics were observed through digital quantum simulation approaches. Despite these exciting progresses, none of them has demonstrated the appropriate type of topological orders and associated non-Abelian anyons whose braidings alone support universal quantum computation. Here, we report the realization of non-Abelian topologically ordered states of the Fibonacci string-net model and demonstrate braidings of Fibonacci anyons featuring universal computational power, with a superconducting quantum processor. We exploit efficient quantum circuits to prepare the desired states and verify their nontrivial topological nature by measuring the topological entanglement entropy. In addition, we create two pairs of Fibonacci anyons and demonstrate their fusion rule and non-Abelian braiding statistics by applying unitary gates on the underlying physical qubits. Our results establish a versatile digital approach to exploring exotic non-Abelian topological states and their associated braiding statistics with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors."}

We theoretically investigate the loss resilience of driven-dissipative entanglement between remote qubits coupled to a chiral waveguide. We find that by coupling a pair of storage qubits to the two driven qubits, the steady state can be tailored such that the storage qubits show a degree of entanglement that is higher than what can be achieved with only two driven qubits coupled to the waveguide. By reducing the degree of entanglement of the driven qubits, we show that the entanglement between the storage qubits becomes more resilient to waveguide loss.

We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement.

This WVA+interferometry protocol uses weak value amplification of the relative delay between two paths to enhance the interferometric sensitivity, approaching the quantum limit for classical light. As an example, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment that achieves few-attosecond timing resolution (few-nanometer path length resolution) with a double-slit interferometer using only common optical components. Since our example uses only the spatial shift of double-slit interference fringes, its precision is not limited by the timing resolution of the detectors, but is instead limited solely by the fundamental shot noise associated with classical light. We experimentally demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by one to three orders of magnitude and approaches the shot-noise limit in the large amplification regime. Previously, quantum-limited WVA delay measurements were thought to require imaginary weak values, which necessitate light with a broad spectral bandwidth and high-resolution spectrometers. In contrast, our protocol highlights the feasibility of using real weak values and narrowband light. Thus, our protocol is a compelling and cost-effective approach to enhance interferometry."}

Subsequently we extend to four-qubit systems, with a specific emphasis on exploring the step-down mode for identifying the primary figure of merit. We showcase the versatility and adaptability of the models by demonstrating the availability of various self-contained setups. A key performance indicator, the capacity of thermal control, is defined to measure the capability of QHTs. An important effect in this study is the proof of existence of a necessarily transient step-down quantum heat transformer, that has a dual-mode characteristic, wherein the desired step-down mode can be realized within the transient regime of an originally designed step-up mode of the QHT. We also investigate how to control this transient domain up to which the necessarily transient mode can be achieved, by regulating the initial temperature of the qubits in the four-qubit settings. Therefore, this quantum heat transformer model not only acts as an analog to the classical voltage transformer, but also enjoys advanced characteristics, enabling it to function in both step-up and step-down modes within the same setup, unattainable for voltage transformers."}

Addressing this question leads to (i) a characterisation of the structure of the thermodynamic arrow of time, (ii) a framework bridging the gap between memoryless and arbitrarily non-Markovian thermodynamic processes, and (iii) a derivation of the famous fluctuation-dissipation relation within a quantum information framework. Finally, the last part of this thesis focuses on studying a ubiquitous phenomenon in science, so-called catalysis. It involves using an auxiliary system (a catalyst) to enable processes that would otherwise be impossible. Over the last two decades, this notion has spread to the field of quantum physics. However, this effect is typically described within a highly abstract framework. Despite its successes, this approach struggles to fully capture the behaviour of physically realisable systems, thereby limiting the applicability of quantum catalysis in practical scenarios. Strikingly, I will demonstrate this effect in a paradigmatic quantum optics setup, namely the Jaynes-Cummings model, where an atom interacts with an optical cavity. The atom plays the role of the catalyst and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity, as evidenced by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity."}

Recent works have explored the concept of certifying nonlocal correlations over extended distances through the use of a local Bell test. Here, an additional quantum device is placed in close proximity to one party, using short-distance correlations to verify nonlocal behavior at long distances. However, existing works have either not resolved the question of DIQKD security against active attackers in this setup, or used methods that do not yield tight bounds on the keyrates. In this work, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate computation task in this setup that can be combined with recently developed methods for analyzing standard DIQKD. Using this method, we show that if the short-distance devices exhibit sufficiently high detection efficiencies, positive key rates can be achieved in the long-distance branch with lower detection efficiencies as compared to standard DIQKD setups.

We present two measurement schemes: balanced photodetection and time-reversed metrology, both utilizing two-mode bright squeezed light. The maximum quantum advantage we can achieve using two-mode bright squeezed light is 3.7 times for the absorption parameter $\\alpha = 0.05$ and 8.4 times for $\\alpha = 0.01$ as compared to using only the coherent state. Similarly, the maximum quantum advantage for the estimation of optical gain is found around 2.81 times for the gain coefficient $G=1.05$ and around 6.28 times for $G=1.01$. We discuss the significance of using one measurement scheme over the other under different squeezing conditions. We compare our results with the Cram\\'er-Rao bound for a two-mode bright squeezed state to assess the quality of the proposed methodologies."}

Prior work of Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen [FOCS '19] further shows (via a technique called simulatable codes) that every language in MIP* has a perfect zero knowledge (PZK) MIP* protocol. The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-round proof systems, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However, the construction in Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen uses six provers, and there is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via simulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZK-MIP* protocols for all of MIP*? In this paper, we show that every language in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK-MIP* protocol, answering the question in the affirmative. For the proof, we use a new method based on a key consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem, which is that every MIP* protocol can be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games. This makes it possible to work with MIP* protocols as boolean constraint systems, and in particular allows us to use a variant of a construction due to Dwork, Feige, Kilian, Naor, and Safra [Crypto '92] which gives a classical MIP protocol for 3SAT with perfect zero knowledge. To show quantum soundness of this classical construction, we develop a toolkit for analyzing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games, which we expect to be useful more broadly. This toolkit also applies to commuting operator strategies, and our argument shows that every language with a commuting operator BCS protocol has a two prover PZK commuting operator protocol."}

As a result of the modification of the exciton's effective mass, Rabi splitting, and dispersion, the relaxation rate of polaritons toward condensation has been significantly modified. Using a continuous pumping, the dynamics of total and condensated polariton versus magnetic field has been clarified. It has been shown that for low-energy pumping, the condensation is significantly reduced with a magnetic field, and this arises from the reduction of the scattering rate between energy levels when the steepness of the dispersion at higher energy is reduced. Increasing of pump energy together with the magnetic field could lead to a more effective relaxation and a much higher number of condensated polariton is obtained."}

We propose an algorithm for approximate classical simulation of a lossy GBS instance.

The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the number of modes given the number of terms is fixed. We describe conditions for the input state squeezing parameter and loss level that provide the best efficiency for this algorithm (by efficient we mean that the Taylor series converges quickly). In recent experiments that claim to have demonstrated quantum advantage, these conditions are satisfied; thus, this algorithm can be used to classically simulate these experiments."}

Primarily, we analyze the dynamics of the Pauli weight in one-dimensional qubit systems evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits has a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits."}

Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using non-commutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fazwi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. We find that in an ideal case routed DIQKD protocols can significantly improve detection efficiency requirements, by up to $\\sim 30\\%$, compared to their non-routed counterparts. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as $50\\%$ for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device."}

Interestingly, we investigate and practically implement this paradigm in experiments, successfully synthesizing a system with dual functionality as both a photonic qubit unidirectional router and a spin-wave diode. By manipulating the helicity of the field, we can effectively balance the coherence coupling and dissipative channel, thereby ensuring the unidirectional transfer of photonic qubits. The qubit fidelity exceeds 97.49%, and the isolation ratio achieves $16.8\\pm0.11$ dB while the insertion loss is lower than 0.36 dB. Furthermore, we show that the spin-wave diode can effectively achieve unidirectional information transfer by appropriately setting the coherent coupling parameters.

Additionally, it investigates the correlation between the reconstruction fidelity and the bipartite values of Bell's Inequality Violation observable among the same parties. By analyzing these connections, this paper aims to ascertain the maximum achievable reconstruction fidelity under the constraints posed by the maximum teleportation fidelity or Bell's Inequality Violation value. In doing so, it provides valuable insights into the fundamental limits of quantum communication protocols, particularly in the realm of secure information transmission."}

By representing environment influences in MPO form, they can be efficiently compressed using established algorithms. The dimensions of inner bonds of the compressed PT-MPO may be viewed as an indicator of the complexity of the environment. Here, we show that the inner bonds themselves, not only their dimensions, have a concrete physical meaning: They represent the subspace of the full environment Liouville space which hosts environment excitations that may influence the subsequent open quantum systems dynamics the most. This connection can be expressed in terms of lossy linear transformations, whose pseudoinverses facilitate the extraction of environment observables. We demonstrate this by extracting the environment spin of a central spin problem, the current through a quantum system coupled to two leads, the number of photons emitted from quantum emitters into a structured environment, and the distribution of the total absorbed energy in a driven non-Markovian quantum system into system, environment, and interaction energy terms. Numerical tests further indicate that different PT-MPO algorithms compress environments to similar subspaces. Thus, the physical interpretation of inner bonds of PT-MPOs both provides a conceptional understanding and it enables new practical applications."}
