The effectiveness of a stress test crucially depends on the choice of stress scenarios. In this paper we consider a pragmatic approach to stress scenario estimation that aims to address several practical challenges in the context of real life financial portfolios of currencies from a bank. Our method utilizes a flexible multivariate modelling framework based on vine copulas."}
