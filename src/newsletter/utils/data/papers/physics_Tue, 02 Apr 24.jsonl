In this paper, we support the development of a mechanics cognitive diagnostic to test and implement effective and equitable pedagogies for physics instruction. Adaptive assessments using cognitive diagnostic models provide significant advantages over fixed-length RBAs commonly used in physics education research. As part of a broader project to develop a cognitive diagnostic assessment for introductory mechanics within an evidence-centered design framework, we identified and tested student models of four skills that cross content areas in introductory physics: apply vectors, conceptual relationships, algebra, and visualizations. We developed the student models in three steps. First, we based the model on learning objectives from instructors. Second, we coded the items on RBAs using the student models. Lastly, we then tested and refined this coding using a common cognitive diagnostic model, the deterministic inputs, noisy ``and'' gate (DINA) model. The data included 19,889 students who completed either the Force Concept Inventory, Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation, or Energy and Momentum Conceptual Survey on the LASSO platform. The results indicated a good to adequate fit for the student models with high accuracies for classifying students with many of the skills. The items from these three RBAs do not cover all of the skills in enough detail, however, they will form a useful initial item bank for the development of the mechanics cognitive diagnostic."}

However, a common challenge across both atom-wise and fragment-wise methods lies in their limited ability to co-design plausible chemical and geometrical structures, resulting in distorted conformations. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Deep Geometry Handling protocol, a more abstract design that extends the design focus beyond the model architecture. Through a comprehensive review of existing geometry-related models and their protocols, we propose a novel hybrid strategy, culminating in the development of FragGen - a geometry-reliable, fragment-wise molecular generation method.

Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency. This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, Our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods. Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\\% (top-5) and 5.4\\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline."}

Here, we propose a novel machine learning architecture to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting force field, Grappa, outperforms established and other machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations, during which large protein are kept stable and small proteins can fold. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations close to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields."}

In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues for three dynamic systems: moving-matter blocs, moving-perturbation interfaces and moving-perturbation periodic structures, and provide corresponding general formulations along with comparisons. Our investigation reveals the significant roles played by the \"catch-up\" effect between waves and interfaces. Even more interestingly, it reveals different energy and momentum exchanges between moving media and homogenized moving-perturbation structures as a result of conventional and reverse Fresnel-Fizeau drag effects."}

Geometry optimizations and Density-functional-based tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) dynamics methods are employed to predict carbon clusters, their time evolution, and their stability. The initial density of the aggregates is found to be of primary importance for the structural properties of the clusters. Aggregates with sufficiently low initial density yield clusters with approximately equal prevalence of sp and sp2 hybridized states and almost missing sp3 ones. The increase in the initial density results in sp2-dominant molecules that resemble the carbon skeleton of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Larger initial aggregations with tetrahedral interatomic orientation result in sp2-dominant multi-dimensional polymers. Such materials are highly porous and resemble axially bound nanotubes. Some resultant clusters resemble fullerene building blocks. Spheroid nanoparticles resembling improper fullerenes are predicted by metadynamics, aimed at inter-fragment coupling reactions. One such structure has the lowest binding energy per atom among the studied molecules. All zero-dimensional forms, obtained by the simulations, conform to the experimentally detected types of molecules in space. The theoretical IR spectrum of the clusters closely resembles that of fullerene C70 and therefore such imperfect structures may be mistaken for known fullerenes in experimental infrared (IR) telescope studies."}

However, traditional manual methods often struggle to effectively control the key variables. This inherent challenge requires a paradigm shift toward automated platforms capable of precise and reproducible experiments. Herein, we use a fully automated device acceleration platform (DAP) to optimize the process parameters for preparing full perovskite devices using a two-step method in ambient air. Eight process parameters that have the potential to significantly influence device performance are systematically optimized. Specifically, we delve into the impact of the dispense speed of organic ammonium halide, a parameter that is difficult to control manually, on both perovskite film and device performance. Through the targeted design of experiments, we reveal that the dispense speed significantly affects device performance primarily by adjusting the residual PbI2 content in the films. We find that moderate dispense speeds, e.g., 50 {\\mu}l/s, contribute to top-performance devices. Conversely, too fast or too slow speeds result in devices with relatively poorer performance and lower reproducibility. The optimized parameter set enables us to establish a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for additive-free perovskite processing under ambient conditions, which yield devices with efficiencies surpassing 23%, satisfactory reproducibility, and state-of-the-art photo-thermal stability. This research underscores the importance of understanding the causality of process parameters in enhancing perovskite photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, our study highlights the pivotal role of automated platforms in discovering innovative workflows and accelerating the development of high-performing perovskite photovoltaic technologies."}

Exploiting the model's gradient-flow structure, we use singular-value decomposition to project modes of deformation of vertices onto modes of deformation of cells. We show how eigenmodes of discrete Laplacian operators (specified by constitutive assumptions related to dissipation and mechanical energy) provide a spatial basis for evolving fields, and demonstrate how the operators can incorporate approximations of conventional spatial derivatives. We relate the spectrum of relaxation times to the eigenvalues of the Laplacians, modified by corrections that account for the fact that the cell network (and therefore the Laplacians) evolve during relaxation to an equilibrium prestressed state, providing the monolayer with geometric stiffness. While dilational modes of the Laplacians capture rapid relaxation in some circumstances, showing diffusive dynamics, geometric stiffness is typically a dominant source of monolayer rigidity, as we illustrate for monolayers exposed to unsteady stretching deformations."}

In our model we describe how the actin retrograde flow controls branch extension, retraction and global cell polarization. We relate the noise in this flow to the residency times and trapping of the cell at the junctions of the network. In addition, we found that macrophages and endothelial cells display very different migration regimes on the network, with macrophages moving faster and having larger changes in cell length in comparison to endothelial cells.

In this work, we address these shortcomings with a hybrid opto-electronic approach that combines simplified optical frequency division with direct digital synthesis to produce tunable low-phase-noise microwaves across the entire X-band. This results in exceptional phase noise at 10 GHz of -156 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset and fractional frequency instability of 1x10^-13 at 0.1 s.

The developed statistical error predictors can be applied to other QoI estimators and nonanalog simulation routines as well. The error analysis is based on interpreting the number of particle visits to a histogram bin as the result of a (correlated) binomial experiment. The resulting expressions can be used to optimize (non)analog particle tracing Monte Carlo methods and hybrid simulation methods involving a Monte Carlo component, as well as to select an optimal particle tracing Monte Carlo method from several available options. Additionally, the cheap statistical error predictors can be used to determine a priori the number of particles N that is needed to reach a desired accuracy. We illustrate the theory using a linear kinetic equation describing neutral particles in the plasma edge of a fusion device and show numerical results. The code used to perform the numerical experiments is openly available."}

The need for fast algorithms within an operational context is considered here as the main design driver. The result is a least-squares fitting procedure that incorporates an analytically formulated approximation of the dynamics under the J2 perturbation, valid for short-term propagation. The algorithm makes use of all available observables, including range-rate, which makes it distinct from other similar methods. The method is compared in a battery of synthetic tests against a classical range and angles fitting method (GTDS) to study the effect of the track length and density of measurements on the full state estimation. The presented methodology is quite versatile, and it is leveraged to improve the estimation quality by adding information of the object's orbital plane obtained from predictions. The resulting method has been named OPOD."}

We characterize the uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross sections using a Bayesian framework. Six collision processes -- elastic momentum transfer, ionization, and four excitations -- are characterized with semi-empirical models, whose parametric uncertainties effectively capture the features important to the macroscopic properties of the plasma, namely transport properties and chemical reaction rates. The method is designed to capture the effects of systematic errors that lead to large discrepancies between some data sets. Specifically, for the purposes of Bayesian inference, each of the parametric cross section models is augmented with a Gaussian process representing systematic measurement errors as well as model inadequacies in the parametric form. The results show that the method is able to capture scatter in the data between the electron-beam experiments and ab-initio quantum simulations. The calibrated cross section models are further validated against measurements from swarm-parameter experiments."}

The modulation phase of the mechanical coupling between the two mechanical modes plays a critical role in determining the mechanical and optical intensity dynamics in the nonlinear regime.

Based on an attentional multi-conditioning strategy, our method also allows non-recurrent supervision on and prediction of intermediate physical states, which provides improved generalization with no additional data-generation cost. Using this O(1)-time intermediate prediction capability, we propose and prove a rigorous, efficiently computable upper bound on prediction error, allowing accuracy guarantees at inference time for all predictions. After training solely on randomized systems, we demonstrate the unified model across a suite of challenging multi-disciplinary inverse problems, finding strong efficacy and speed improvements up to 96% for problems in optical tomography, beam shaping through volumetric random media, and freeform photonic inverse design, with no problem-specific training.

The K\\\"arger model consists of two homogeneous exchanging components coupled by an exchange rate constant and assumes measurements are made with sufficiently long diffusion time and slow water exchange. Despite successful applications, it remains unclear whether these assumptions are generally valid for practical dMRI sequences and biological tissues. In particular, barrier-induced restrictions to diffusion produce inhomogeneous magnetization distributions in relatively large-sized compartments such as cancer cells, violating the above assumptions. The effects of this inhomogeneity are usually overlooked. We performed computer simulations to quantify how restriction effects, which in images produce edge enhancements at compartment boundaries, influence different variants of the K\\\"arger-model. The results show that the edge enhancement effect will produce larger, time-dependent estimates of exchange rates in e.g., tumors with relatively large cell sizes (>10 {\\mu}m), resulting in overestimations of water exchange as previously reported. Moreover, stronger diffusion gradients, longer diffusion gradient durations, and larger cell sizes, all cause more pronounced edge enhancement effects. This helps us to better understand the feasibility of the K\\\"arger model in estimating water exchange in different tissue types and provides useful guidance on signal acquisition methods that may mitigate the edge enhancement effect. This work also indicates the need to correct the overestimated transcytolemmal water exchange rates obtained assuming the K\\\"arger-model."}

This coupling leads to oscillations of nuclear parameters that are detectable by comparing clocks with different sensitivities to these nature's constants. Vibrational transitions of molecular clocks are more sensitive to a change in the nuclear parameters than the electronic transitions of atomic clocks. Here, we propose the iodine molecular ion, I$_2^+$, as a sensitive detector for such a class of ULDM models. The iodine's dense spectrum allows us to match its transition frequency to that of an optical atomic clock (Ca$^+$) and perform correlation spectroscopy between the two clock species.

The detailed information entropy budget analysis of this system reveals that the linear rotation terms plays a minor role in the generation of uncertainties as compared to the orography and the surface friction.

Many recent studies about ARs focused on the statistical analyses of ARs, but a process-level understanding of ARs remains elusive. Here we show that ARs are streams of air with enhanced vapor kinetic energy (VKE) and derive a governing equation for Integrated VKE (IVKE) to understand what contributes to the evolution of ARs. We find that ARs grow mainly because of potential energy conversion to kinetic energy, decay largely owing to condensation and turbulence, and the eastward drift is primarily due to horizontal advection of VKE. Our VKE framework complements the integrated vapor transport framework, which is popular for identifying ARs but lacks a prognostic equation for understanding the physical processes."}

The oxygen reduction and evolution reactions were found to occur at similar potentials to those observed on a smooth, planar glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The effect of the porosity and the resultant increase in surface area were readily observed in the increase in the transient time required for the intermediates to reach the ring and the much larger disk currents (compared to smooth, planar GC) recorded respectively. The RRDE data was analyzed using a kinetic model previously developed by us and the rate constant of the elementary reactions calculated. The rates constant for the electrochemical reactions were found to be similar in magnitude to the rate constants calculated for smooth GC disks. The porosity of the electrode was found to decrease the rate of desorption of the intermediate and the product and delay their diffusion by shifting it from a Fickian regime in the electrolyte bulk to the Knudsen regime in the film pores. Thus, it is shown that the effect of the electrode porosity on the kinetics of the ORR is physical rather than electrochemical."}

This is validated by characterizing the torsional actuation response of twisted and annealed nylon fibers. The second ingredient of the model is to use the classic Kirchhoff Rod Theory and add a necessary term that couples the bending and twisting energy. Validation with experiments shows that the model captures the equilibrium and longitudinal stiffness of the TCPA in both active and passive states, and the stimulated contraction under external load. Importantly, the model quantifies the influence of the stored energy level on the actuation performance. These concepts can be extended to other types of TCPAs and could enable new material design."}

It discusses their crucial roles in understanding surface-subsurface crustal dynamics, outlining their principles, strengths, and limitations. Additionally, it provides insights into the induced polarization method and briefly discusses the self-potential method. The review thoroughly examines the mapping of surface-subsurface resistivity and velocity structures, crucial for comprehending Earth's surface, deep crustal, and hazard processes. Despite the numerous benefits of these techniques, challenges persist, necessitating multidisciplinary approaches due to lithology heterogeneities, geological process nuances, and geophysical data uncertainties. Hence, the emergence of machine learning and deep learning in ERT and SRT significantly enhances their accuracy in inversion modeling and geological feature identification. This integration of domain-specific knowledge with data- and image-driven approaches effectively addresses subsurface characterization challenges. Case studies utilizing real-time field electrical and seismic P-wave velocity datasets illustrate concepts, accompanied by the development of new methodological frameworks and analytical modeling. These frameworks provide systematic data modeling, facilitating velocity-resistivity relationships for enhanced geological characterization. This evidence underscores the importance of leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to obtain a broader range of parameters for subsurface structure delineation, environmental risk assessment, and informed decision-making. Ongoing research innovation is anticipated to continue improving capabilities in subsurface geophysical exploration."}

Here, we report a piezoelectric-based in-situ uniaxial strain technique enabling simultaneous electrical transport and optical spectroscopy characterization of dual-gated vdW heterostructure devices. Critically, our technique remains compatible with vdW heterostructure devices of arbitrary complexity fabricated on conventional silicon/silicon dioxide wafer substrates. We demonstrate a large and continuously tunable strain of up to $0.15$\\% at millikelvin temperatures, with larger strain values also likely achievable. We quantify the strain transmission from the silicon wafer to the vdW heterostructure, and further demonstrate the ability of strain to modify the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene.

Then, the derivative of the objective function with respect to a change of coils in shape is formulated according to the concept of shape optimisation. The resulting shape derivative (as well as the Biot--Savart's law) is smoothly discretised with the closed B-spline curves. In this case, the control points (CPs) of the curves are naturally selected as the design variables. As a consequence, the shape derivative is discretised to the sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the CPs. Those sensitivities are available to solve the present shape-optimisation problem with a certain gradient-based nonlinear-programming solver.

This study comprises of a comprehensive investigation of key parameters affecting flame spread rate, including fuel radius and opposed flow speed in normal gravity and microgravity environments. A 2-D axisymmetric flame spread model accounted for char and numerical simulations were performed which revealed valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing flame spread over such geometry. The results computed from the numerical model is compared with the experimentally observed flame spread rate to validate the numerical model which can be used to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. As the radius of circular duct increases the flame spread rate increases both in normal gravity and microgravity environments. The conduction heat feedback and radiation heat gain coming from hot char through gas phase at inner core region are the two major mechanisms which controls the flame spread phenomena over the circular duct fuels.

In particular, we are concerned with the steady, viscous, time-averaged flow that persists in the vicinity on the cylinder, when the stroke length of the oscillating flow, $U_{\\infty}/\\omega$ is smaller or comparable to the radius of the post, $a$, where $U_{\\infty}$ and $\\omega$ are the mean velocity amplitude and the corresponding angular frequency, respectively. First, we analyze the asymptotic limit of small values of the stroke length varying the aspect ratio of the post $\\lambda$ and the Womersley number $M$. First-order steady-streaming corrections at leading order have been computed, together with associated Stokes-drift component, the sum of both yielding the mean Lagrangian velocity field. The confinement effect is seen to induce the three-dimensionality of flow. Moreover, in the mid plane the time-averaged steady flow exhibits a recirculating vortex attached to the wall of the post that decreases as $M$ increases for low values of $M$. However, for values of $M$ larger than a critical one, $M_{cr}(\\lambda)$, a second, outer vortex is also formed. The dependence $M_{cr}(\\lambda)$ has been quantified.

To solve the problem of identifying nodes that have high influence in a complex system, we propose a higher-order distance-based fuzzy centrality methods (HDF and EHDF) that are customized for a hypergraph which can characterize higher-order interactions between nodes via hyperedges. The methods we proposed assume that the influence of a node is reliant on the neighboring nodes with a certain higher-order distance. We compare the proposed methods with the baseline centrality methods to verify their effectiveness. Experimental results on six empirical hypergraphs show that the proposed methods could better identify influential nodes, especially showing plausible performance in finding the top influential nodes. Our proposed theoretical framework for identifying influential nodes could provide insights into how higher-order topological structure can be used for tasks such as vital node identification, influence maximization, and network dismantling."}

However, the elaborated structure of the organ of Corti can support multiple modes motion. Here, systems of two coupled oscillators are examined as the simplest models of the system with multiple modes of motion.

The MTD will consist of barrel and endcap timing layers, BTL and ETL respectively, providing precision timing of charged particles. The BTL sensors are based on LYSO:Ce scintillation crystals coupled to SiPMs with TOFHIR2 ASICs for the front-end readout. A resolution of 30-60 ps for MIP signals at a rate of 2.5 Mhit/s per channel is expected along the HL-LHC lifetime. We present an overview of the TOFHIR2 requirements and design, simulation results and measurements with TOFHIR2 ASICs. The measurements of TOFHIR2 associated to sensor modules were performed in different test setups using internal test pulses or blue and UV laser pulses emulating the signals expected in the experiment. The measurements show a time resolution of 24 ps initially during Beginning of Operation (BoO) and 58 ps at End of Operation (EoO) conditions, matching well the BTL requirements. We also showed that the time resolution is stable up to the highest expected MIP rate. Extensive radiation tests were performed, both with x-rays and heavy ions, showing that TOFHIR2 is not affected by the radiation environment during the experiment lifetime."}
