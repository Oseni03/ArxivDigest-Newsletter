Among the 30 quasars, seven (23%) exhibit [O II] emitting nebulae with major axis sizes greater than 100 kpc, twenty greater than 50 kpc (67%), and 27 (90%) greater than 20 kpc. Such large, optically emitting nebulae indicate that cool, dense, and metal-enriched circumgalactic gas is common in the halos of luminous quasars at intermediate redshift. Several of the largest nebulae exhibit morphologies that suggest interaction-related origins. We detect no correlation between the sizes and cosmological dimming corrected surface brightnesses of the nebulae and quasar redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, or radio-loudness, but find a tentative correlation between the nebulae and rest-frame [O II] equivalent width in the quasar spectra. This potential trend suggests a relationship between ISM content and gas reservoirs on CGM scales. The [O II]-emitting nebulae around the $z\\approx1$ quasars are smaller and less common than Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae around $z\\approx3$ quasars. These smaller sizes can be explained if the outer regions of the Ly$\\alpha$ halos arise from scattering in more neutral gas, by evolution in the cool CGM content of quasar host halos, by lower-than-expected metallicities on $\\gtrsim50$ kpc scales around $z\\approx1$ quasars, or by changes in quasar episodic lifetimes between $z=3$ and $1$."}

We improve the tidal disruption model of satellite galaxies in L-Galaxies to address the time dependence problem. We utilise the public code CLOUDY to compute emission line ratios for a grid of HII region models. The emission line models assume the same initial mass function as that used to generate the spectral energy distribution of semi-analytical galaxies, ensuring a coherent treatment for modelling the full galaxy spectrum. By incorporating these emission line ratios with galaxy properties, we reproduce observed luminosity functions for H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, [OII], and [OIII] in the local Universe and at high redshifts. We also find good agreement between model predictions and observations for auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions of [OII]-selected galaxies, as well as their luminosity dependence. The bias of emission line galaxies depends on both luminosity and redshift. At lower redshifts, it remains constant with increasing luminosity up to around $\\sim 10^{42.5}\\rm \\, erg\\,s^{-1}$ and then rises steeply for higher luminosities. The transition luminosity increases with redshift and becomes insignificant above $z$=1.5. Generally, galaxy bias shows an increasing trend with redshift. However, for luminous galaxies, the bias is higher at low redshifts, as the strong luminosity dependence observed at low redshifts diminishes at higher redshifts. We provide a fitting formula for the bias of emission line galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift, which can be utilised for large-scale structure studies with future galaxy surveys."}

These forward-scattering polarization signals, which are of high interest for magnetic field diagnostics, have always been modeled either under the assumption of complete frequency redistribution (CRD), or taking partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects into account under the angle-averaged (AA) approximation. This work aims at assessing the suitability of the CRD and PRD-AA approximations for modeling the forward-scattering polarization signals produced by the presence of an inclined magnetic field, the so-called forward-scattering Hanle effect, in the chromospheric CaI 4227 A line. Radiative transfer calculations are performed in semi-empirical 1D solar atmospheres, out of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). A two-step solution strategy is applied: the non-LTE RT problem is first solved considering a multilevel atom and neglecting polarization phenomena. The same problem is then solved including polarization, considering a two-level atom and keeping fixed the lower-level population calculated at the previous step. The emergent linear polarization signals calculated under the CRD and PRD-AA approximations are analyzed and compared to those obtained by modeling PRD effects in their general angle-dependent (AD) formulation. With respect to the PRD-AD case, the CRD and PRD-AA calculations significantly underestimate the amplitude of the line-center polarization signals produced by the forward-scattering Hanle effect. The results of this work suggest that a PRD-AD modeling is required in order to develop reliable diagnostic techniques exploiting the forward-scattering polarization signals observed in the CaI 4227 A line. These results need to be confirmed by full 3D calculations including non-magnetic symmetry-breaking effects."}

Peter, S.K. Solanki, R. Cameron, I. De Moortel", "subjects": "Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)", "abstract": "Observed spectral profiles of emission lines from the corona are found to have widths exceeding the thermal line width. To investigate the physical mechanism, we run a 3D MHD model of a single, straightened loop in which we partially resolve turbulent motions that form in response to the driving by self-consistently evolving magneto-convection in the photosphere. The convective motions shear and twist the magnetic field lines, leading to heating. From the model we synthesize spectral profiles of emission lines forming at temperatures around and above 1 MK. The coronal heating process generates a range of velocity amplitudes and directions structured on a scale much smaller than the resolving power of current instruments, leading to a broadening of the spectral lines. Our model includes the mass exchange between corona and chromosphere, thus we also capture flows parallel to the loop axis. We find that the spectral lines show a non-thermal line broadening roughly consistent with observations for a viewing angle perpendicular to the axis. The broadening through field-parallel flows is comparable, although slightly smaller. The line broadening is independent of the instrument resolution for a perpendicular line-of-sight. We can connect the non-thermal line broadening to heating events and flows. While small-scale velocities along the line-of-sight are mainly responsible for the broadening observed perpendicular to the loop, chromospheric evaporation is important for the line broadening observed along the loop. The model reproduces observed values for non-thermal line widths. In the model these result from continuous driving by magnetoconvection, without imposing driving motions or starting from an already braided field."}

Our simulations show that the dwarf satellite CGM removal is fast and effective: more than $95\\%$ of the CGM mass is ram-pressure-stripped within a few hundred Myrs, even under a weak ram pressure orbit where the ISM stripping is negligible. The conditions for CGM survival are consistent with the analytical halo gas stripping predictions in McCarthy et al. (2008). We also find that including the satellite CGM does not effectively shield its galaxy, and therefore the ISM stripping rate is unaffected. Our results imply that a dwarf galaxy CGM is unlikely to be detected in satellite galaxies; and that the star formation of gaseous dwarf satellites is likely devoid of replenishment from a CGM."}

Vasanth", "subjects": "Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)", "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed study of the type II solar radio burst that occurred on 06 March 2014 using combined data analysis. It is a classical radio event consisting of type III radio burst and a following type II radio burst in the dynamic spectrum. The type II radio burst is observed between 235 - 130 MHz (120 - 60 MHz) in harmonic (fundamental) bands with the life time of 5 minutes between 09:26 UT - 09:31 UT. The estimated speed of type II burst by applying twofold Saito model is 650 km/s. An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave is observed with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) pass bands. The very close temporal onset association of EUV wave and flare energy release indicates that the EUV wave is likely produced by a flare pressure pulse. The eruption is also accompanied by a weak coronal mass ejection (CME) observed with the coronagraphs onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). The plane of sky speed of the CME was 252 km/s at SOHO/LASCO-C2 and 280 km/s at STEREO-B/SECCHI-COR1 FOV. The EUV wave has two wave fronts, one expanding radially outward, and the other one moving along the arcade. The source position of the type II burst imaged by the Nancay Radio Heliograph (NRH) shows that it was associated with the outward moving EUV wave. The CME is independent of the shock wave as confirmed by the location of NRH radio sources below the CME's leading edge. Therefore the type II radio burst is probably ignited by the flare. This study shows the possibility of EUV wave and coronal shock triggered by flare pressure pulse, generating the observed type II radio burst."}

These models are most often based on the isothermal density profile -- not an optimal description of the halo, but easy to use because it leads to an analytic deflection-angle formula. Dark-matter halos are better described by the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile. We set out to study lensing by a general triaxial ellipsoidal NFW halo, with the aim of providing an analytic model that would be more consistent with the current understanding of dark-matter halos. We computed the conversion between the properties of a triaxial ellipsoidal lens model and its elliptical surface-density profile. In the case of the NFW lens model, its angular scale is defined by the projected scale semi-major axis of the halo, while its lensing regime depends on two parameters: the projected eccentricity $e$ and the convergence parameter $\\kappa_\\text{s}$. We employed the Bourassa \\& Kantowski formalism to compute the complex scattering function of the model, which yields the deflection-angle components when separated into its real and imaginary parts. We present the obtained closed-form expressions for the deflection-angle components, valid for an arbitrary eccentricity of the surface-density profile. We use them to compute and describe the lensing properties of the model, including: the shear, its components, and the phase; critical curves, caustics, and the parameter-space mapping of their geometries; the deformations and orientations of images. The analytically solved ellipsoidal NFW lens model is available for implementation in gravitational lensing software.

We evaluated the performance of the model using real data observed from the 40-meter radio telescope at Yunnan Observatory. Furthermore, we compared our results to other models, including U-Net, RFI-Net, and R-Net, using four commonly employed evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU.

We demonstrate that the MR relation obtained from these two selections can be converted to each other by using the $M_\\star-\\mathscr{M}$ relation. Finally, we provide a 7-parameter fitting result comprehensively capturing the dependence of the MR relation on both stellar mass cutoff and redshift."}

It is possible that pulsars may actually be strange stars, but not neutron stars. Here we present a short review on recent progresses in the field of strange quark stars. Three popular phenomenological models widely used to describe strange quark matter are introduced, with special attention being paid on the corresponding equation of state in each model. Combining the equation of state with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations, the inner structure and mass-radius relation can be obtained for the whole sequence of strange stars. Strong gravitational wave emissions may be generated by strange stars through various mechanisms, which may help identify strange stars via observations. Especially, close-in strange quark planets with respect to their hosts may provide a unique test for the existence of strange quark objects. Fierce electromagnetic bursts could also be generated by strange stars. The energy may come from the phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars, or from the merger of binary strange stars. The collapse of the strange star crust can also release a huge amount of energy. It is shown that strange quark stars may be involved in short gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts."}

We find that for the clouds in the hot phase ($T>10^5$ K), the two methods produce significantly different mass fractions and velocities of the cloud material. In contrast, the two methods produce similar results for the clouds that are in the warm/cold phases ($T < 10^5$ K).

We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.5, 145, and 225 GHz. These observations confirmed the millimeter excess within the central <100 pc region and its time variability based on two separate observations conducted four days apart. The timescale of variability aligns with the light crossing time for a compact source smaller than <100 Schwarzschild radius. If we take into account the power-law synchrotron emission originating from the corona (i.e., the hot plasma located above the accretion disk), the millimeter spectrum indicates the coronal magnetic field of ~10 G and the size of ~10 Schwarzschild radius. An alternative explanation for this millimeter emission could be synchrotron and free-free emission from disk winds (i.e., fast wide-opening angle outflows from the disk) with the size of ~10 pc, although it may be difficult to explain the fast variability. Future millimeter observations with higher resolution (~0.01\") will enable the differentiation between these two scenarios.

However, such black holes may form through hierarchical formation channels, as the result of merging \"ancestor\" black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' black hole, namely its mass, spin, and recoil velocity (or kick). Crucially, the child black hole will be expelled from its host environment if its \"birth kick\" exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing it from undergoing further mergers. In this work, we exploit tight relations between the final kick and final spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth kicks of the component black holes of GW190521, assuming both quasi-circular (with generic spins) eccentric (aligned-spin) scenarios for the latter. With this, we evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes, being retained by the host environment. For the primary component BH1, which falls squarely in the PISN mass gap, we find that such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster, unless GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors, characteristic of isolated black-hole binary formation scenarios. Similarly, for denser host environments (excluding AGNs), we only obtain probabilities $p_{2g} > 0.5$ if GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors. If GW190521 was eccentric, we find maximal values $p_{2g}$ of only $p_{2g} \\simeq 0.1$ which require ancestral mass ratios $q\\geq 2$, untypical of isolated formation scenarios.

There are however several issues with this method: Bayes' ratio depends on the prior even in the limit of non-informative priors, and Jeffrey's scale, used to assess the test, is arbitrary. Moreover, the standard use of Bayes' ratio is often criticized for being unable to reject models. In this paper, we address these shortcoming by promoting evidences and evidence ratios to frequentist statistics and deriving their sampling distributions. By comparing the evidence ratios to their sampling distributions, poor fitting models can now be rejected. Our method additionally does not depend on the prior in the limit of very weak priors, thereby safeguarding the experimenter against premature rejection of a theory with a uninformative prior, and replaces the arbitrary Jeffrey's scale by probability thresholds for rejection. We provide analytical solutions for some simplified cases (Gaussian data, linear parameters, and nested models), and we apply the method to cosmological supernovae Ia data.

The aim of this paper is to consider relationship between the decay of sunspots and convection via the motion of the family of granules and how the diffusion mechanism of magnetic field operates in a decaying sunspot. Methods. We report the decay of a sunspot observed by the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) with the TiO Broadband Filter Imager (BFI) and the Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS). The analysis was aided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). In the first step, we followed the decay of the sunspot with HMI data over three days by constructing its evolving area and total magnetic flux. In the second step, the high spatial and temporal resolution of the GST instruments allowed us to analyze the causes of the decay of the sunspot. Afterward, we followed the emergence of granules in the moat region around the sunspot over six hours. The evolution of the trees of fragmenting granules (TFGs) was derived based on their relationship with the horizontal surface flows. Results. We find that the area and total magnetic flux display an exponential decrease over the course of the sunspot decay. We identified 22 moving magnetic features (MMFs) in the moats of pores, which is a signature of sunspot decay through diffusion. We note that the MMFs were constrained to follow the borders of TFGs during their journey away from the sunspot. Conclusions. The TFGs and their development contribute to the diffusion of the magnetic field outside the sunspot. The conclusion of our analysis shows the important role of the TFGs in sunspot decay. Finally, the the family of granules evacuates the magnetic field."}

This could roughly explain the absence of stars within $2.5 \\times 10^4 R_{\\rm g}$ ($\\sim$ 1000 AU). Additionally, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, induced by the gravitational perturbation of the disk, could contribute to the bimodal distribution of S-star inclinations and drive a majority of stars into high eccentricity orbits."}

We also model the well-known QPO source, RE J1034+396, which falls in this frequency band, as an EMRI assuming its primary black hole mass to be $10^6-10^7 M_\\odot$. Through a prior-predictive analysis, we estimate the orbiting compact object's mass to be $46^{+ 10}_{-40} M_\\odot$ and the source's LISA-band SNR as $\\approx 14$, highlighting it as a candidate multi-messenger EMRI target. We also highlight the role of current and near-future X-ray and UV observatories in enabling multi-messenger observations of EMRIs in conjunction with LISA, and conclude with a discussion of caveats of the current analysis, such as the exclusion of eccentricity and inclination from the model, and the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object EMRIs."}

The surface brightness there is too low to create V from stars of a reasonable mass-to-light ratio. To maintain a stable disk, a massive dark matter halo is usually assumed to dominate in creating V. Gravitational arm amplification is used here to estimate whether V is created by a disk mixture, or by a 100 percent halo. The disk surface density is not estimated from the disk surface brightness and an assumed mass to light ratio. The observed arm pitch angle is presumed to be long term maximally amplified. This permits calculation of the disk surface mass density with radius relative to a 100 percent disk which would fully create V. NGC 7217's tightly wound 4.8 degree arm pitch angle indicates a disk component contributing 43 percent of the observed V for the range over the spiral arms (important but not dominant). It has too low a disk density to create V with the rest presumably arising from a halo. V is proportional to the square root of surface density. By contrast a loose arm galaxy disk can dominate in creating V. For example NGC 3198's arm pitch angle of 30 degrees implies a disk surface density sufficient to account for 88 percent of V which is a dominant fraction. Little dark matter halo is needed for galaxies like this. Observationally, the dark outer disk may be molecular hydrogen. NGC 3198's dominant disk also provides a counter example to the need for any universal (MOND) force law modification over the outer disk spiral arms."}

We study the resilience of gas in subhalos, focusing on the impact of tidal and ram pressure stripping through hydrodynamic simulations. Our results uncover significant gas stripping primarily driven by ram pressure effects, which also profoundly influence the gas distribution within these subhalos. Notably, despite their vulnerability to ram pressure effects, the low-mass subhalos can play a pivotal role in influencing the observable characteristics of cosmic structures due to their large abundance. Specifically, we explore the application of our findings to the 21 cm forest, showing how the survival dynamics of gas in subhalos can modulate the 21 cm optical depth, a key probe for detecting minihalos in the pre-reionization era.

Once extracted, a model is fit to the spectra to measure the observables, leading to an understanding of the underlying physics of the emission mechanism. One crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of this model is the background emission, which contains foreground and background astrophysical sources, intervening atmospheric emission, and artifacts related to the instrument such as noise. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to constructing a background model for SITELLE observations using statistical tools and supervised machine learning algorithms. We apply a segmentation algorithm implemented in photutils to divide the data cube into background and source spaxels. After applying a principal component analysis (PCA) on the background spaxels, we train an artificial neural network to interpolate from the background to the source spaxels in the PCA coefficient space, which allows us to generate a local background model over the entire data cube. We highlight the performance of this methodology by applying it to SITELLE observations obtained of a SIGNALS galaxy, \\NGC4449, and the Perseus galaxy cluster of galaxies, NGC 1275. We discuss the physical interpretation of the principal components and noise reduction in the resulting PCA-based reconstructions. Additionally, we compare the fit results using our new background modeling approach to standard methods used in the literature and find that our method better captures the emission from HII regions in NGC 4449 and the faint emission regions in NGC 1275. These methods also demonstrate that the background does change as a function of the position of the datacube."}

If this is the case, these systems would be attractive targets for indirect searches of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) annihilation due to their relative proximity and high expected DM content. In this study, we analyze 14.3 years of gamma-ray data collected by the Fermi-LAT coincident with 26 UFCSs. No significant excess gamma-ray emission is detected, and we present gamma-ray flux upper limits for these systems. Assuming that the UFCSs are dark-matter-dominated galaxies consistent with being among the faintest and least massive MW dwarf spheroidal (dSphs) satellite galaxies, we derive the projected sensitivity for a dark matter annihilation signal. We find that observations of UFCSs have the potential to yield some of the most powerful constraints on DM annihilation, with sensitivity comparable to observations of known dSphs and the Galactic center.

On the other hand, the data obtained from DECaLS DR10 and VIKING DR4 ESO surveys were used to estimate photometric masses. We found that passive galaxies dominate the population of AC114 in the cluster center, whereas the star-forming members tend to be located outside this region. The constructed MZR from the latter indicates that AC114 SF galaxies have a lower metallicity content than foreground galaxies (z up to 0.28) and the same or even lower metallicities with respect to background galaxies (spanning redshifts 0.34 to 0.70), producing slightly a shallower slope compared to the field MZR at z~0.3. Additionally, it shows a higher scatter of 0.17 dex, consistent with MZRs of galaxy clusters reported in the literature. The responsible mechanisms behind the scatter are consistent with simulations and observations where dynamic and environmental effects such as galaxy-galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping are shaping the chemical evolution of the AC114 SF members. The former mechanism can decrease gas-phase metallicities because of pristine gas infall to the galaxy's outskirts, and the latter increases gas-phase metallicities because of the stripping of the metal-poor gas located at the outskirts of the SF members. The AC114 SF members are metal-poorer than field galaxies at the same redshift, so the cluster dominated by galaxy-galaxy interactions is the best scenario that explains the slightly shallower slope and the higher scatter of the AC114-MZR compared to the field MZR at z~0.3."}
