Nevertheless, almost all recommender works are focused on how to describe user preferences by the implicit click/like interactions, to find the synergy of people. For the content-based explicit comments/reviews interactions, some works attempt to utilize them to mine the semantic knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, they still neglect the following two points: (1) The content semantic is a universal world knowledge; how do we extract the multi-aspect semantic information to empower different domains? (2) The user/item ID feature is a fundamental element for recommender models; how do we align the ID and content semantic feature space? In this paper, we propose a `plugin' semantic knowledge transferring method \\textbf{LoID}, which includes two major components: (1) LoRA-based large language model pretraining to extract multi-aspect semantic information; (2) ID-based contrastive objective to align their feature spaces. We conduct extensive experiments with SOTA baselines on real-world datasets, the detailed results demonstrating significant improvements of our method LoID."}

However, the industrial community mainly adopts interactive interfaces to encourage users to select pre-defined scenarios, which may hinder the downstream ranking performance. In addition, in the academic community, the multi-scenario ranking works only come from other fields, and there are no works specifically focusing on route data due to lacking a publicly available MSRR dataset. Moreover, all the existing multi-scenario works still fail to address the three specific challenges of MSRR simultaneously, i.e. explosion of scenario number, high entanglement, and high-capacity demand. Different from the prior, to address MSRR, our key idea is to factorize the complicated scenario in route ranking into several disentangled factor scenario patterns. Accordingly, we propose a novel method, Disentangled Scenario Factorization Network (DSFNet), which flexibly composes scenario-dependent parameters based on a high-capacity multi-factor-scenario-branch structure. Then, a novel regularization is proposed to induce the disentanglement of factor scenarios. Furthermore, two extra novel techniques, i.e. scenario-aware batch normalization and scenario-aware feature filtering, are developed to improve the network awareness of scenario representation. Additionally, to facilitate MSRR research in the academic community, we propose MSDR, the first large-scale publicly available annotated industrial Multi-Scenario Driving Route dataset. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our DSFNet, which has been successfully deployed in AMap to serve the major online traffic."}

Chi, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy", "subjects": "Information Retrieval (cs.IR)", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used as backbones for recommender systems. However, their performance often lags behind conventional methods in standard tasks like retrieval. We attribute this to a mismatch between LLMs' knowledge and the knowledge crucial for effective recommendations. While LLMs excel at natural language reasoning, they cannot model complex user-item interactions inherent in recommendation tasks. We propose bridging the knowledge gap and equipping LLMs with recommendation-specific knowledge to address this. Operations such as Masked Item Modeling (MIM) and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) have found success in conventional recommender systems. Inspired by this, we simulate these operations through natural language to generate auxiliary-task data samples that encode item correlations and user preferences. Fine-tuning LLMs on such auxiliary-task data samples and incorporating more informative recommendation-task data samples facilitates the injection of recommendation-specific knowledge into LLMs. Extensive experiments across retrieval, ranking, and rating prediction tasks on LLMs such as FLAN-T5-Base and FLAN-T5-XL show the effectiveness of our technique in domains such as Amazon Toys & Games, Beauty, and Sports & Outdoors. Notably, our method outperforms conventional and LLM-based baselines, including the current SOTA, by significant margins in retrieval, showcasing its potential for enhancing recommendation quality."}

However, most SBRSs primarily maximize recommendation accuracy but ignore user minor preferences, thus leading to filter bubbles in the long run. Only a handful of works, being devoted to improving diversity, depend on unique model designs and calibrated loss functions, which cannot be easily adapted to existing accuracy-oriented SBRSs. It is thus worthwhile to come up with a simple yet effective design that can be used as a plugin to facilitate existing SBRSs on generating a more diversified list in the meantime preserving the recommendation accuracy. In this case, we propose an end-to-end framework applied for every existing representative (accuracy-oriented) SBRS, called diversified category-aware attentive SBRS (DCA-SBRS), to boost the performance on recommendation diversity. It consists of two novel designs: a model-agnostic diversity-oriented loss function, and a non-invasive category-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets showcase that our framework helps existing SBRSs achieve extraordinary performance in terms of recommendation diversity and comprehensive performance, without significantly deteriorating recommendation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-oriented SBRSs."}

Despite significant advances in representation disentanglement to capture diverse user preferences, existing methods usually neglect representation enhancement and lack rigorous decoupling constraints, thereby limiting the transfer of relevant information. To this end, we propose a Unified Framework for Adaptive Representation Enhancement and Inversed Learning in Cross-Domain Recommendation (AREIL). Specifically, we first divide user embeddings into domain-shared and domain-specific components to disentangle mixed user preferences. Then, we incorporate intra-domain and inter-domain information to adaptively enhance the ability of user representations. In particular, we propose a graph convolution module to capture high-order information, and a self-attention module to reveal inter-domain correlations and accomplish adaptive fusion. Next, we adopt domain classifiers and gradient reversal layers to achieve inversed representation learning in a unified framework. Finally, we employ a cross-entropy loss for measuring recommendation performance and jointly optimize the entire framework via multi-task learning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the substantial improvement in the recommendation performance of AREIL. Moreover, ablation studies and representation visualizations further illustrate the effectiveness of adaptive enhancement and inversed learning in CDR."}

The relation between generative retrieval and other retrieval methods, especially those based on matching within dense retrieval models, is not yet fully comprehended. Prior work has demonstrated that generative retrieval with atomic identifiers is equivalent to single-vector dense retrieval. Accordingly, generative retrieval exhibits behavior analogous to hierarchical search within a tree index in dense retrieval when using hierarchical semantic identifiers. However, prior work focuses solely on the retrieval stage without considering the deep interactions within the decoder of generative retrieval. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that generative retrieval and multi-vector dense retrieval share the same framework for measuring the relevance to a query of a document. Specifically, we examine the attention layer and prediction head of generative retrieval, revealing that generative retrieval can be understood as a special case of multi-vector dense retrieval. Both methods compute relevance as a sum of products of query and document vectors and an alignment matrix. We then explore how generative retrieval applies this framework, employing distinct strategies for computing document token vectors and the alignment matrix. We have conducted experiments to verify our conclusions and show that both paradigms exhibit commonalities of term matching in their alignment matrix."}

They are mainly designed in sequential pipelines, requiring lots of data to train different sub-systems, and are hard to scale to new domains. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalized capabilities, enabling a singular model to tackle diverse recommendation tasks across various scenarios. Nonetheless, existing LLM-based recommendation systems utilize LLM purely for a single task of the recommendation pipeline. Besides, these systems face challenges in presenting large-scale item sets to LLMs in natural language format, due to the constraint of input length. To address these challenges, we introduce an LLM-based end-to-end recommendation framework: UniLLMRec. Specifically, UniLLMRec integrates multi-stage tasks (e.g. recall, ranking, re-ranking) via chain-of-recommendations. To deal with large-scale items, we propose a novel strategy to structure all items into an item tree, which can be dynamically updated and effectively retrieved. UniLLMRec shows promising zero-shot results in comparison with conventional supervised models. Additionally, it boasts high efficiency, reducing the input token need by 86% compared to existing LLM-based models. Such efficiency not only accelerates task completion but also optimizes resource utilization.

However, the existing studies on CDR did not address the scenarios where both users and items partially overlap across multi-retail channels which we define as \"cross-channel retail recommendation (CCRR)\". This paper introduces our original work on CCRR using real-world datasets from a multi-channel retail store.

Previous QPP methods typically return a single scalar value and do not require the predicted values to approximate a specific information retrieval (IR) evaluation measure, leading to certain drawbacks: (i) a single scalar is insufficient to accurately represent different IR evaluation measures, especially when metrics do not highly correlate, and (ii) a single scalar limits the interpretability of QPP methods because solely using a scalar is insufficient to explain QPP results. To address these issues, we propose a QPP framework using automatically generated relevance judgments (QPP-GenRE), which decomposes QPP into independent subtasks of judging the relevance of each item in a ranked list to a given query. This allows us to predict any IR evaluation measure using the generated relevance judgments as pseudo-labels; Also, this allows us to interpret predicted IR evaluation measures, and identify, track and rectify errors in generated relevance judgments to improve QPP quality. We judge relevance by leveraging a leading open-source large language model (LLM), LLaMA, to ensure scientific reproducibility. In doing so, we address two main challenges: (i) excessive computational costs of judging the entire corpus for predicting a recall-based metric, and (ii) poor performance in prompting LLaMA in a zero-/few-shot manner. We devise an approximation strategy to predict a recall-oriented IR measure and propose to fine-tune LLaMA using human-labeled relevance judgments. Experiments on the TREC 2019-2022 deep learning tracks show that QPP-GenRE achieves state-of-the-art QPP accuracy for both lexical and neural rankers in both precision- and recall-oriented metrics."}
