Further, we show that the multivariate Dickman distribution is the unique distribution satisfying a certain stability property and that a related stochastic process is self-similar. Along the way we develop applications to non-Gaussian OU-Processes, to the class of generalized multivariate gamma distributions, and to the popular Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard stochastic volatility model."}

Differently from previous literature, we do not assume full knowledge of the initial and final goods distribution over the network nodes. In spite of the meager information, we show that it is possible to characterize the most likely flow in two important cases: The first one is when the initial and/or final distribution is only known on proper subsets of the nodes. The second case is when only some moments of the marginal distributions are known. As an important by-product, we determine the most likely initial and final marginals on the whole state space."}

Lysetskyi, Ya.I.

Specifically, we examine the random vector representing the number of individuals preceding generation $n$, often referred to as the total progeny. By conditioning on non-extinction or extinction at current time, and properly normalizing it, we derive the asymptotic distribution for this vector. Similar theorem is derived for process with immigration. The key determinant of this distributions is the limit of $n(\\rho-1)$ as $n$ tends to infinity and $\\rho$ approaches 1."}

In two space dimensions, this just fails to fall into the standard theory of stochastic homogenization, and leads to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$. The latter was carried out by a scale-by-scale homogenization, and implemented by monitoring the corrector $\\phi_L$ for geometrically increasing cut-off scales $L^+=ML$. In fact, proxies $(\\tilde\\phi_L,\\tilde\\sigma_L)$ for the corrector and flux corrector were introduced incrementally and the residuum $f_L$ estimated. In this short supplementary note, we reproduce the arguments of the above paper in the continuum setting of $M\\downarrow 1$. This has the advantage that the definition of the proxies $(\\tilde\\phi_L,\\tilde\\sigma_L)$ becomes more transparent -- it is given by a simple It\\^{o} SDE with $\\ln L$ acting as a time variable. It also has the advantage that the residuum $f_L$, which is a martingale, can be efficiently and precisely estimated by It\\^{o} calculus. This relies on the characterization of the quadratic variation of the (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian driver."}

A special case includes $\\nabla^\\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*>0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process."}

The argument relies on a resolvent comparison and a tail bound for Gauss-divisible matrices. The latter can be obtained by the method of partial Schur decomposition. Using this bound we prove that any finite collection of components of a right eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue uniformly sampled from a neighbourhood of a point in the bulk is Gaussian. A byproduct of the calculation is an asymptotic formula for the odd moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of real Gauss-divisible matrices."}
