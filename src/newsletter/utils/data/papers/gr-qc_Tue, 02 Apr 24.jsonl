We investigate the extent of these biases over a year-long observing run with $10^5$ simulated binary black hole sources using the linear signal approximation. To establish a conservative estimate, we sample binaries from a smoothed truncated power-law population model and compute systematic parameter biases between the IMRPhenomXAS and IMRPhenomD waveform models.

Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\\gamma_{\\,PPN}=\\frac{\\omega+1}{\\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\\gamma_{\\,exact}=\\frac{\\omega+1+(\\omega+2)\\varTheta}{\\omega+2+(\\omega+1)\\varTheta}$ where $\\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\\parallel^*+2P_\\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\\gamma_{\\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\\varTheta\\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\\varTheta\\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\\omega$ and $\\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\\varTheta\\simeq1$, $\\gamma_{\\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\\omega$.

Weinberg", "subjects": "General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)", "abstract": "We investigate the dynamical tide in coalescing binaries involving neutron stars (NSs). The deformed NS is assumed to spin rapidly, with its spin axis anti-aligned with the orbit. Such an NS may exist if the binary forms dynamically, and it can lead to a strong tide because the NS f-mode can be resonantly excited during the inspiral. We present a new analytical solution for the f-mode resonance by decomposing the tide into a resummed equilibrium component varying at the forcing frequency and a dynamical component varying at the mode eigenfrequency. This solution simplifies numerical implementations by avoiding the subtraction of two diverging terms. It also extends the solution's validity to frequencies beyond mode resonance. When the dynamical tide back reacts on the orbit, the effective Love number alone is insufficient because it does not capture the tidal torque on the orbit that dominates the back reaction during resonance. An additional dressing factor is therefore introduced to model the torque. The dissipative interaction between the NS and the orbital mass multipoles is computed including the dynamical tide and shown to be subdominant compared to the conservative interaction. We show that orbital phase shifts caused by the $l=3$ and $l=2$ f-modes can reach 0.5 and 10 radians at their respective resonances. Because of the large impact of the dynamical tide, a linearized description becomes insufficient, calling for future developments to incorporate higher-order corrections. After mode excitation, the orbit cannot remain quasi-circular, and the eccentricity excited by the $l=2$ dynamical tide can approach nearly $e\\simeq 0.1$, leading to non-monotonic frequency evolution. Lastly, we demonstrate that the GW radiation from the resonantly excited f-mode alone can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding unity at a distance of 50 Mpc with the next-generation GW detectors."}

We estimate the free parameters for such quantum metrics through a simple physical argument based on Heisenberg uncertainty principle, along with alternative proposals as asymptotic safety, trace anomaly, and graviton corpuscular scaling. Our findings reveal a significant decrease in entropy compared to the area law near the origin for the quantum metrics.

Our finding, based on a set of gauge/frame invariant diagnostics, is that slow contraction robustly and rapidly smooths and flattens spacetime beginning from initial conditions that are outside the perturbative regime of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, whereas inflation fails these tests. We present new numerical evidence supporting the conjecture that the combination of ultralocal evolution and an effective equation-of-state with pressure much greater than energy density is the key to having robust and rapid smoothing. The opposite of ultralocality occurs in expanding spacetimes, which is the leading obstruction to smoothing following a big bang."}

As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr Hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A time-like membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon which is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the Membrane Paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole."}

In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging."}

In this paper, we take the Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar model with an electrically charged scalar field gauge-coupled to the Maxwell field surrounding a charged black hole in the background of a static spherically symmetric metric. We ascertain the validity of all energy conditions coupled with the causality condition, suggesting the possibility of existence of charged hairy solutions. Consequently, we obtain, by exact numerical integration, detailed solutions of the field equations in this model. The solutions exhibit damped oscillatory behaviours for the charged scalar hair. We also find that the electric potential $V(r)$ is a monotonic function of $r$, as required by electrodynamics. Furthermore, we find that the charged hairy solutions are stable against time-dependant perturbations about the static solutions. We ascertain their stability by carrying out dynamic stability analyses, employing two different methodologies. The first methodology is based on a Sturm-Liouville equation, whereas the second methodology employs a Schrodinger-like equation for the dynamic perturbations.

Although these improvements were developed within the highly efficient NR code BlackHoles@Home, we demonstrate their effectiveness in the widely adopted Einstein Toolkit/Carpet AMR framework. Our improvements include a modified Kreiss-Oliger dissipation prescription, a Hamiltonian-constraint-damping adjustment to the BSSN equations, and an additional term to the 1+log lapse evolution equation that slows the development of the sharp lapse feature, which dominates numerical errors in BBH simulations. With minimal increase in computational cost, these improvements significantly reduce GW noise, enabling the extraction of high-order GW modes previously obscured by numerical noise. They also improve convergence properties, reduce Hamiltonian (momentum) constraint violations in the strong-field region by approximately two (three) orders of magnitude, and in the GW-extraction zone by six (two) orders of magnitude. To promote community adoption, we have open-sourced the improved Einstein Toolkit thorn BaikalVacuum used in this work.
