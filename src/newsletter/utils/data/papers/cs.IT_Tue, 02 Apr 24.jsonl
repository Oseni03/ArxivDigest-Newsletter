Letaief", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)", "abstract": "Within the realm of rapidly advancing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), distributed detection assumes a significant role in various practical applications. However, critical challenge lies in maintaining robust detection performance while operating within the constraints of limited bandwidth and energy resources. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines model-driven deep learning (DL) with binary quantization to strike a balance between communication overhead and detection performance in WSNs. We begin by establishing the lower bound of detection error probability for distributed detection using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Furthermore, we prove the global optimality of employing identical local quantizers across sensors, thereby maximizing the corresponding Chernoff information. Subsequently, the paper derives the minimum MAP detection error probability (MAPDEP) by inplementing identical binary probabilistic quantizers across the sensors. Moreover, the paper establishes the equivalence between utilizing all quantized data and their average as input to the detector at the fusion center (FC). In particular, we derive the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures the difference between the true posterior probability and output of the proposed detector. Leveraging the MAPDEP and KL divergence as loss functions, the paper proposes model-driven DL method to separately train the probability controller module in the quantizer and the detector module at the FC. Numerical results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves near-optimal performance with reduced complexity for Gaussian hypothesis testing."}

Implicitly, the framework levels value, representation and information separately. Given the fact that there exists a coincidental equivalence between Von Neumann universe and originally-formalized motivation in ZFC, this work hypothesizes the essential of ordered values for one monand, to carry out efficient communication with the rest. This work then focuses on the relationship among values, representation and information (and suggests potential methods for quantitative analysis). First, this framework generalizes the definition of values and representations from \"Indexes approximate Values\" principle by (Peng 2023) via surreal numbers (Knuth 1974). Second, credited to surreal numbers, this work recursively connects representations and information via subsets of sets. Therefore, the definition to metric space(s) is naturally formed by representations, and quantitative methods (e.g., Hausdorff Distance) can be applied for quantitative analysis among (sub)sets. Third, this framework conjectures that: as long as the metric space is (or can be formed as) complete, the existence tests can be performed via Cauchy Sequence (or its generalized methods). This work finally revisits the communication theory, and suggests new perspectives from the new analytic framework. Particularly, this work hypothesizes a (quantitative) relationship between values and representation, and conjectures that: the optimal construction of representations exists, and it can be derived as the core value of one monad via Cauchy Inequality (or its generalized methods)."}

To curtail deployment expenses and power consumption for mmWave band operations, each AP incorporates a hybrid digital-analog structure encompassing precoder/combiner functions.

In this paper, we first present a hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing framework and derive explicit expressions for both uplink and downlink achievable rates. Then we formulate a power allocation problem to maximize the weighted bidirectional sum rates. To tackle this non-convex problem, we develop a collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm called multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) for NAFD cell-free mmWave networks. Specifically, given the tightly coupled nature of both uplink and downlink power coefficients in NAFD cell-free mmWave networks, the MATD3 algorithm resolves such coupled conflicts through an interactive learning process between agents and the environment. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation methods within our hybrid MIMO processing paradigm, and demonstrate that our MATD3 algorithm outperforms both multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and conventional power allocation strategies."}

This paper considers the problem of joint communication and computation resource management in a two-stage edge learning system. In this system, model pre-training is first conducted at an edge server via centralized learning on local pre-stored general data, and then task-specific fine-tuning is performed at edge devices based on the pre-trained model via federated edge learning. For the two-stage learning model, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the average squared gradient norm bound), which characterizes the impacts of various system parameters such as the number of learning rounds and batch sizes in the two stages on the convergence rate. Based on our analytical results, we then propose a joint communication and computation resource management design to minimize an average squared gradient norm bound, subject to constraints on the transmit power, overall system energy consumption, and training delay. The decision variables include the number of learning rounds, batch sizes, clock frequencies, and transmit power control for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design. It is shown that the proposed joint resource management over the pre-training and fine-tuning stages well balances the system performance trade-off among the training accuracy, delay, and energy consumption. The proposed design is also shown to effectively leverage the inherent trade-off between pre-training and fine-tuning, which arises from the differences in data distribution between pre-stored general data versus real-time task-specific data, thus efficiently optimizing overall system performance."}

It has been shown that randomized codes can be strictly better under a number of formulations. In particular, the role of common randomness has been well studied. We elucidate the role of private randomness in the compression of a memoryless source $X^n=(X_1,...,X_n)$ under two kinds of realism constraints. The near-perfect realism constraint requires the joint distribution of output symbols $(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ to be arbitrarily close the distribution of the source in total variation distance (TVD). The per-symbol near-perfect realism constraint requires that the TVD between the distribution of output symbol $Y_t$ and the source distribution be arbitrarily small, uniformly in the index $t.$ We characterize the corresponding asymptotic rate-distortion trade-off and show that encoder private randomness is not useful if the compression rate is lower than the entropy of the source, however limited the resources in terms of common randomness and decoder private randomness may be."}

We demonstrate that with an appropriate proportion of generalized constraint (GC) nodes, GLDPC codes can reduce the original gap to capacity compared to their original LDPC counterparts over the BEC and BI-AWGN channels. Additionally, on the BI-AWGN channel, we adopt Gaussian mixture distributions to approximate the message distributions from variable nodes and Gaussian distributions for those from constraint nodes. This approximation technique significantly enhances the precision of the channel parameter threshold compared to traditional Gaussian approximations while maintaining a low computational complexity similar to that of Gaussian approximations. Our simulation experiments provide empirical evidence that GLDPC codes, when decoded with the APP decoder and equipped with the right fraction of GC nodes, can achieve substantial performance improvements compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes."}
