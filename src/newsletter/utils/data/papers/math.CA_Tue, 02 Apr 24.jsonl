We give a system of hypergeometric differential equations annihilating the series. Under some non-integral conditions on parameters, we give an Euler type integral representation of the series, and linearly independent $p^m$ solutions to this system around a point near to the origin. We show that this system is of rank $p^m$, and determine its singular locus."}

Riesz  transforms", "authors": "Michael Lacey, Ji Li, Brett D. Wick, Liangchuan Wu", "subjects": "Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)", "abstract": "We characterize the Schatten class $S^p$ of the commutator of Riesz transforms $[b,R_j]$ in $\\mathbb R^n$ ($j=1,\\ldots, n$) in the two weight setting for $n< p<\\infty$, by introducing the condition that the symbol $b$ being in Besov spaces associated with the given two weights. At the critical index $p=n$, the commutator being in the weak Schatten class $S^{n,\\infty}$ is characterized by the symbol $b$ being in an oscillation sequence space associated with the given two weights. As a direct application, we have the Schatten class estimate for A. Connes' quantised derivative in the two weight setting."}
