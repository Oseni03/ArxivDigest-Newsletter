To address this issue, we propose a novel control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as {\\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation."}
