Given an interface connection (A,B), we define a backward solution operator consistent with the concept of AB-entropy solution [4,13,16]. We then analyze the family A^{[AB]}(T) of profiles that can be attained at time T>0 by AB-entropy solutions with L^\\infty-initial data. We provide a characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) as fixed points of the backward-forward solution operator. As an intermediate step we establish a full characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) in terms of unilateral constraints and Ole\\v{\\i}nik-type estimates, valid for all connections. Building on such a characterization we derive uniform BV bounds on the flux of AB-entropy solutions, which in turn yield the L^1_{loc}-Lipschitz continuity in time of these solutions."}

The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number, which is shown to be necessary. A counterexample is derived in the form of an exponentially increasing travelling wave solution of the linearized equation, indicating a possible explanation of traveling bands, which have been observed in the literature in simulations with an individual based model. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally."}

Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here, we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker-Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modelling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as"}

When $p>2$, we find an unexpected $\\mathrm{L}^q-\\mathrm{L}^\\infty$ regularization: the surprise comes from the fact that this result is false in the linear case $p=2$.

When $p>1$ is integer we can reach $C^\\infty$ regularity (gained in time, preserved in space) and even analyticity in time. The regularity estimates that we obtain are quantitative and constructive (all computable constants), and have a local character, allowing us to show further properties of the solutions: for instance, initial singularities do not move with time. We also study the asymptotic behavior for large times of solutions to Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Our results are new also in the linear case and are sharp when $p$ is integer. We expect them to be optimal for all $p>1$, supporting this claim with some numerical simulations."}

Firstly, we prove that any hydrostatic equilibrium reveals long-time instability when the initial data are perturbed in Sobolev spaces of low regularity. Secondly, we establish asymptotic stability of the stratified density, which is strictly decreasing in the vertical direction, under sufficiently regular perturbations, proving that the solution converges to the unique minimizer of the total energy. Our analysis is based on the energy method. Although the total energy dissipates due to kinematic viscosity, such mechanism cannot capture the stratification of the density. We overcome this difficulty by discovering another Lyapunov functional which exhibits the density stratification in a quantitative manner."}
