We create a dissipative system by starting with a finite polysquare translation surface, and then modifying it by including a one-sided barrier on a common vertical edge of two adjacent atomic squares, in the form of a union of finitely many intervals. The line flow in this system partitions the system into a transient set and a recurrent set. We are interested in the geometry of these two sets."}

Theory Dyn. Syst., 21(6):1657-1681, 2001] and presents fundamental theorems for developing the theory. Pluripotency reprograms dynamics from a statistical or geometrical point of view. This means that the dynamics of various codes, including non-trivial Dirac physical measures or historic behavior, can be observably and stochastically realized by arbitrarily small perturbations. We first give a practical condition equivalent to a stronger version of pluripotency. Next, we show that the property of pluripotency is $C^{r} (2\\leq r<\\infty)$-robust. Precisely, there exists a $C^{r}$-open set of non-hyperbolic diffeomorphisms that have wild blender-horseshoes and are strongly pluripotent. It implies a new affirmative solution to Takens' last problem for $C^{r}$ diffeomorphisms of dimension $n\\geq 3$."}

The approach begins with a two-parameter continuation along which a tool based on the theory of Poincar\\'e index is employed to identify the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Using the approximate cusp location, Newton's method is then applied to a given augmented system (the cusp map), yielding a more precise numerical approximation of the cusp. Through a successful application of a Newton-Kantorovich type theorem, we establish the existence of a non-degenerate zero of the cusp map in the vicinity of the numerical approximation. Employing a Gershgorin circles argument, we then prove that exactly one eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix at the cusp candidate has zero real part, thus rigorously confirming the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Finally, by incorporating explicit control over the cusp's location, a rigorous enclosure for the normal form coefficient is obtained, providing the explicit dynamics on the center manifold at the cusp. We show the effectiveness of this method by applying it to four distinct models."}

A common issue arises from defectors seeking to obtain an excessive share of these resources for personal gain, potentially leading to resource depletion. To mitigate this tragedy and ensure sustainable development of resources, implementing mechanisms to either reward those who adhere to distribution rules or penalize those who do not, appears advantageous. We introduce two models: a tax-reward model and a tax-punishment model, to address this issue. Our analysis reveals that in the tax-reward model, the evolutionary trajectory of the system is influenced not only by the tax revenue collected but also by the natural growth rate of the resources. Conversely, the tax-punishment model exhibits distinct characteristics when compared to the tax-reward model, notably the potential for bistability. In such scenarios, the selection of initial conditions is critical, as it can determine the system's path. Furthermore, our study identifies instances where the system lacks stable points, exemplified by a limit cycle phenomenon, underscoring the complexity and dynamism inherent in managing public resources using these models."}

Alamin, Bryan S. Hernandez", "subjects": "Dynamical Systems (math.DS)", "abstract": "Power law systems have been studied extensively due to their wide-ranging applications, particularly in chemistry. In this work, we focus on an important subclass of power law systems, which generalizes the mass action framework where every pair of reactions sharing identical reactant complexes possesses identical kinetic order vectors, that can be decomposed into stoichiometrically independent subsystems. We show that for such systems, if the deficiencies of the underlying individual subnetworks sum up to the deficiency of the entire network, and the ranks of the augmented matrices containing the kinetic order vectors of the subnetworks sum up to the rank of the augmented matrix containing the kinetic order vectors of the entire network, then the existence of the positive steady states of each stoichiometrically-independent subsystem is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the positive steady states of the given power law system. We illustrate this result by providing illustrative examples, one of which is a network of a carbon cycle model that satisfies the assumptions, while the other network fails to meet the assumptions. Finally, using the aforementioned result, we present a systematic method for deriving positive steady state parametrizations for the mentioned subclass of power law systems with identical stoichiometrically independent subnetworks, which is a generalization of our recent method for mass action systems."}

Accordingly, the most well-adopted choice of the coupling function is the sine function. Due to the oddness of the sine function, the synchronized frequency would be the average of all the natural frequencies. In this article, we study the synchronization behaviors of the Kuramoto model with a pure competition coupling function. Namely, instead of the sine function, we choose $\\max \\{0, \\sin \\theta \\}$ to be the coupling function. This indicates the relation of pure competition between oscillators. We prove asymptotical phase synchronization for identical oscillators and asymptotical frequency synchronization for non-identical oscillators under reasonable sufficient conditions. In particular, under our sufficient conditions, the synchronized frequency is the maximal frequency of all the natural frequencies. On the other hand, in the parameter regime which is out of the scope of the analysis of our theorems, it is possible that the synchronized frequency could be larger than the maximal frequency of the natural frequencies of all the oscillators. In this article, we also provide numerical experiments to support the analysis of our theorem and to demonstrate the aforementioned phenomenon."}

By taking into account that there exists a one-to one correspondence between Poisson--Lie groups and Lie bialgebra structures, a number of deformed Poisson coalgebras can be obtained, which allow the construction of integrable deformations of coupled Rikitake systems. Moreover, the integrals of the motion for coupled systems can be explicitly obtained by means of the deformed coproduct map. The same procedure can be also applied when the initial system is bi-Hamiltonian with respect to two different Lie-Poisson algebras. In this case, to preserve a bi-Hamiltonian structure under deformation, a common Lie bialgebra structure for the two Lie-Poisson structures has to be found. Coupled dynamical systems arising from this bi-Hamiltonian deformation scheme are also presented, and the use of collective `cluster variables', turns out to be enlightening in order to analyse their dynamical behaviour. As a general feature, the approach here presented provides a novel connection between Lie bialgebras and integrable dynamical systems."}
