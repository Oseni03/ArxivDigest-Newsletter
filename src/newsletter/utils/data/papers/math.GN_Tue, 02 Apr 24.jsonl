After distinguishing this property from the Lindel\\\"of property we make various remarks about cardinal invariants of SDL spaces. For example we prove that $|X| \\leq 2^{\\chi(X)}$ for every SDL Urysohn space and that every SDL $P$-space of character $\\leq \\omega_1$ is regular and has cardinality $\\leq 2^{\\omega_1}$. Finally, we exploit our results to obtain some partial answers to questions about the cardinality of cellular-Lindel\\\"of spaces."}

In particular, we prove that if $T:C_p(X)\\to C_p(Y)$ is a continuous linear surjection, then $\\dim Y=0$ if $\\dim X=0$. This provides a positive answer to a question raised by Kawamura-Leiderman \\cite[Problem 3.1]{kl}."}
