In this study, we propose an approach for extracting singular patterns from discrete planar vector fields. Our method involves converting the planar discrete vector field into a specialized digraph and computing its one-dimensional persistent path homology. By analyzing the persistence diagram, we can determine the location of singularity and segment a region of the singular pattern, which is referred to as a singular polygon. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in analyzing the centers and impact areas of tropical cyclones."}
