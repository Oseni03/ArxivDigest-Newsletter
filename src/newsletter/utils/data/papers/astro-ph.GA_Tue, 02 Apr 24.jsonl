Among the 30 quasars, seven (23%) exhibit [O II] emitting nebulae with major axis sizes greater than 100 kpc, twenty greater than 50 kpc (67%), and 27 (90%) greater than 20 kpc. Such large, optically emitting nebulae indicate that cool, dense, and metal-enriched circumgalactic gas is common in the halos of luminous quasars at intermediate redshift. Several of the largest nebulae exhibit morphologies that suggest interaction-related origins. We detect no correlation between the sizes and cosmological dimming corrected surface brightnesses of the nebulae and quasar redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, or radio-loudness, but find a tentative correlation between the nebulae and rest-frame [O II] equivalent width in the quasar spectra. This potential trend suggests a relationship between ISM content and gas reservoirs on CGM scales. The [O II]-emitting nebulae around the $z\\approx1$ quasars are smaller and less common than Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae around $z\\approx3$ quasars. These smaller sizes can be explained if the outer regions of the Ly$\\alpha$ halos arise from scattering in more neutral gas, by evolution in the cool CGM content of quasar host halos, by lower-than-expected metallicities on $\\gtrsim50$ kpc scales around $z\\approx1$ quasars, or by changes in quasar episodic lifetimes between $z=3$ and $1$."}

We improve the tidal disruption model of satellite galaxies in L-Galaxies to address the time dependence problem. We utilise the public code CLOUDY to compute emission line ratios for a grid of HII region models. The emission line models assume the same initial mass function as that used to generate the spectral energy distribution of semi-analytical galaxies, ensuring a coherent treatment for modelling the full galaxy spectrum. By incorporating these emission line ratios with galaxy properties, we reproduce observed luminosity functions for H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, [OII], and [OIII] in the local Universe and at high redshifts. We also find good agreement between model predictions and observations for auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions of [OII]-selected galaxies, as well as their luminosity dependence. The bias of emission line galaxies depends on both luminosity and redshift. At lower redshifts, it remains constant with increasing luminosity up to around $\\sim 10^{42.5}\\rm \\, erg\\,s^{-1}$ and then rises steeply for higher luminosities. The transition luminosity increases with redshift and becomes insignificant above $z$=1.5. Generally, galaxy bias shows an increasing trend with redshift. However, for luminous galaxies, the bias is higher at low redshifts, as the strong luminosity dependence observed at low redshifts diminishes at higher redshifts. We provide a fitting formula for the bias of emission line galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift, which can be utilised for large-scale structure studies with future galaxy surveys."}

The conditions for CGM survival are consistent with the analytical halo gas stripping predictions in McCarthy et al. (2008).

These models are most often based on the isothermal density profile -- not an optimal description of the halo, but easy to use because it leads to an analytic deflection-angle formula. Dark-matter halos are better described by the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile. We set out to study lensing by a general triaxial ellipsoidal NFW halo, with the aim of providing an analytic model that would be more consistent with the current understanding of dark-matter halos. We computed the conversion between the properties of a triaxial ellipsoidal lens model and its elliptical surface-density profile. In the case of the NFW lens model, its angular scale is defined by the projected scale semi-major axis of the halo, while its lensing regime depends on two parameters: the projected eccentricity $e$ and the convergence parameter $\\kappa_\\text{s}$. We employed the Bourassa \\& Kantowski formalism to compute the complex scattering function of the model, which yields the deflection-angle components when separated into its real and imaginary parts. We present the obtained closed-form expressions for the deflection-angle components, valid for an arbitrary eccentricity of the surface-density profile. We use them to compute and describe the lensing properties of the model, including: the shear, its components, and the phase; critical curves, caustics, and the parameter-space mapping of their geometries; the deformations and orientations of images. The analytically solved ellipsoidal NFW lens model is available for implementation in gravitational lensing software. The techniques introduced here such as the image-plane analysis can prove to be useful for understanding the properties of other lens models as well."}

We find that the structure of the diagram is depended on age of a supershell and physical conditions of a gas in the disk. We argue that the diagrams obtained for the nearby dwarf galaxies can be interpreted by only using the dynamics of bubbles driven by multiple supernova explosions in low-mass stellar clusters of different age."}

We find that for the clouds in the hot phase ($T>10^5$ K), the two methods produce significantly different mass fractions and velocities of the cloud material. In contrast, the two methods produce similar results for the clouds that are in the warm/cold phases ($T < 10^5$ K). We find that the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability is suppressed in the warm clouds of size $\\sim$100 pc and metallicity $Z\\gt 0.1 Z_\\odot$ due to effective gas cooling.

We demonstrate that the dust particles that are evacuated from their 'parent' clouds to the hot medium show different dynamics when compared to that of the Lagrangian (trace) particles. Our results indicate that the dust grains swept out to the hot gas are destroyed."}

We also determined the approximate stellar disk mass associated with the SFCs using IRAC 3.6-micron images.

However, the median size of the SFCs in the dwarf irregulars is the largest compared to the other two types when compared at roughly the same distance. We have derived the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) on the scale of SFCs for all three classes of SFDGs. We find that although all SFDGs approximately follow the global SFMS relation, i.e. $SFR\\propto {M_{*}}^{\\alpha}$ (where globally $\\alpha\\approx1$ for low surface brightness galaxies and $0.9$ for SFDGs), on the scale of SFCs the $\\alpha$ value for each type is different.

We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.5, 145, and 225 GHz. These observations confirmed the millimeter excess within the central <100 pc region and its time variability based on two separate observations conducted four days apart. The timescale of variability aligns with the light crossing time for a compact source smaller than <100 Schwarzschild radius. If we take into account the power-law synchrotron emission originating from the corona (i.e., the hot plasma located above the accretion disk), the millimeter spectrum indicates the coronal magnetic field of ~10 G and the size of ~10 Schwarzschild radius. An alternative explanation for this millimeter emission could be synchrotron and free-free emission from disk winds (i.e., fast wide-opening angle outflows from the disk) with the size of ~10 pc, although it may be difficult to explain the fast variability. Future millimeter observations with higher resolution (~0.01\") will enable the differentiation between these two scenarios.

The surface brightness there is too low to create V from stars of a reasonable mass-to-light ratio. To maintain a stable disk, a massive dark matter halo is usually assumed to dominate in creating V. Gravitational arm amplification is used here to estimate whether V is created by a disk mixture, or by a 100 percent halo. The disk surface density is not estimated from the disk surface brightness and an assumed mass to light ratio. The observed arm pitch angle is presumed to be long term maximally amplified. This permits calculation of the disk surface mass density with radius relative to a 100 percent disk which would fully create V. NGC 7217's tightly wound 4.8 degree arm pitch angle indicates a disk component contributing 43 percent of the observed V for the range over the spiral arms (important but not dominant). It has too low a disk density to create V with the rest presumably arising from a halo. V is proportional to the square root of surface density. By contrast a loose arm galaxy disk can dominate in creating V. For example NGC 3198's arm pitch angle of 30 degrees implies a disk surface density sufficient to account for 88 percent of V which is a dominant fraction. Little dark matter halo is needed for galaxies like this. Observationally, the dark outer disk may be molecular hydrogen. NGC 3198's dominant disk also provides a counter example to the need for any universal (MOND) force law modification over the outer disk spiral arms."}

Once extracted, a model is fit to the spectra to measure the observables, leading to an understanding of the underlying physics of the emission mechanism. One crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of this model is the background emission, which contains foreground and background astrophysical sources, intervening atmospheric emission, and artifacts related to the instrument such as noise. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to constructing a background model for SITELLE observations using statistical tools and supervised machine learning algorithms. We apply a segmentation algorithm implemented in photutils to divide the data cube into background and source spaxels. After applying a principal component analysis (PCA) on the background spaxels, we train an artificial neural network to interpolate from the background to the source spaxels in the PCA coefficient space, which allows us to generate a local background model over the entire data cube. We highlight the performance of this methodology by applying it to SITELLE observations obtained of a SIGNALS galaxy, \\NGC4449, and the Perseus galaxy cluster of galaxies, NGC 1275. We discuss the physical interpretation of the principal components and noise reduction in the resulting PCA-based reconstructions. Additionally, we compare the fit results using our new background modeling approach to standard methods used in the literature and find that our method better captures the emission from HII regions in NGC 4449 and the faint emission regions in NGC 1275. These methods also demonstrate that the background does change as a function of the position of the datacube."}

The constructed MZR from the latter indicates that AC114 SF galaxies have a lower metallicity content than foreground galaxies (z up to 0.28) and the same or even lower metallicities with respect to background galaxies (spanning redshifts 0.34 to 0.70), producing slightly a shallower slope compared to the field MZR at z~0.3. Additionally, it shows a higher scatter of 0.17 dex, consistent with MZRs of galaxy clusters reported in the literature. The responsible mechanisms behind the scatter are consistent with simulations and observations where dynamic and environmental effects such as galaxy-galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping are shaping the chemical evolution of the AC114 SF members. The former mechanism can decrease gas-phase metallicities because of pristine gas infall to the galaxy's outskirts, and the latter increases gas-phase metallicities because of the stripping of the metal-poor gas located at the outskirts of the SF members. The AC114 SF members are metal-poorer than field galaxies at the same redshift, so the cluster dominated by galaxy-galaxy interactions is the best scenario that explains the slightly shallower slope and the higher scatter of the AC114-MZR compared to the field MZR at z~0.3."}
