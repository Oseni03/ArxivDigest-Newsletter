Reidy, Eliot J. Smith", "subjects": "Computational Complexity (cs.CC)", "abstract": "In this paper, we examine Yangjun Chen's technical report titled ``The 2-MAXSAT Problem Can Be Solved in Polynomial Time'' [Che23], which revises and expands upon their conference paper of the same name [Che22]. Chen's paper purports to build a polynomial-time algorithm for the ${\\rm NP}$-complete problem 2-MAXSAT by converting a 2-CNF formula into a graph that is then searched. We show through multiple counterexamples that Chen's proposed algorithms contain flaws, and we find that the structures they create lack properly formalized definitions. Furthermore, we elaborate on how the author fails to prove the correctness of their algorithms and how they make overgeneralizations in their time analysis of their proposed solution. Due to these issues, we conclude that Chen's technical report [Che23] and conference paper [Che22] both fail to provide a proof that ${\\rm P}={\\rm NP}$."}

In other words, there is no randomized constant-cost problem $Q \\in BPP^0$, such that all other problems $P \\in BPP^0$ can be computed by a constant-cost deterministic protocol with access to an oracle for $Q$. We also show that the $k$-Hamming Distance problems form an infinite hierarchy within $BPP^0$. Previously, it was known only that Equality is not complete for $BPP^0$. We introduce a new technique, using Ramsey theory, that can prove lower bounds against arbitrary oracles in $BPP^0$, and more generally, we show that $k$-Hamming Distance matrices cannot be expressed as a Boolean combination of any constant number of matrices which forbid large Greater-Than subproblems."}

The objective of the problem is to minimize the total energy consumed for completing these tasks by assigning the tasks to k heterogeneous machines. We first show that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we present polynomial-time algorithms for two special cases where there are only two machines and where the input DAG is a directed path. Finally, we study a natural variant where there are only two machines with one of them being capable of executing a limited number of tasks. We show that this special case remains computationally hard."}

Using this theory we provide a new proof of the correctness of Zhuk's algorithm for all tractable CSPs on a finite domain, and therefore a new simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture. Additionally, using the new theory we prove that composing a weak near-unanimity operation of an odd arity $n$ we can derive an $n$-ary operation that is symmetric on all two-element sets. Thus, CSP over a constraint language $\\Gamma$ on a finite domain is tractable if and only if there exist infinitely many polymorphisms of $\\Gamma$ that are symmetric on all two-element sets."}
